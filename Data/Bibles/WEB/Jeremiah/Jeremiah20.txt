1 Now Pashhur , the son of Immer the priest , who was chief officer in Yahweh 's house , heard Jeremiah prophesying these things .
2 Then Pashhur struck Jeremiah the prophet , and put him in the stocks that were in the upper gate of Benjamin , which was in Yahweh 's house .
3 On the next day , Pashhur released Jeremiah out of the stocks . Then Jeremiah said to him , Yahweh has not called your name Pashhur , but Magormissabib .
4 For Yahweh says , Behold , I will make you a terror to yourself , and to all your friends ; and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies , and your eyes shall see it ; and I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon , and he shall carry them captive to Babylon , and shall kill them with the sword .
5 Moreover I will give all the riches of this city , and all its gains , and all the precious things of it , yes , all the treasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of their enemies ; and they shall make them captives , and take them , and carry them to Babylon .
6 You , Pashhur , and all who dwell in your house shall go into captivity ; and you shall come to Babylon , and there you shall die , and there you shall be buried , you , and all your friends , to whom you have prophesied falsely .
7 Yahweh , you have persuaded me , and I was persuaded ; you are stronger than I , and have prevailed : I am become a laughing-stock all the day , every one mocks me .
8 For as often as I speak , I cry out ; I cry , Violence and destruction ! because Yahweh 's word is made a reproach to me , and a derision , all the day .
9 If I say , I will not make mention of him , nor speak any more in his name , then there is in my heart as it were a burning fire shut up in my bones , and I am weary with forbearing , and I ca n't .
10 For I have heard the defaming of many , terror on every side . Denounce , and we will denounce him , say all my familiar friends , those who watch for my fall ; perhaps he will be persuaded , and we shall prevail against him , and we shall take our revenge on him .
11 But Yahweh is with me as an awesome mighty one : therefore my persecutors shall stumble , and they shall not prevail ; they shall be utterly disappointed , because they have not dealt wisely , even with an everlasting dishonor which shall never be forgotten .
12 But , Yahweh of Armies , who tests the righteous , who sees the heart and the mind , let me see your vengeance on them ; for to you have I revealed my cause .
13 Sing to Yahweh , praise Yahweh ; for he has delivered the soul of the needy from the hand of evildoers .
14 Cursed is the day in which I was born : do n't let the day in which my mother bore me be blessed .
15 Cursed is the man who brought news to my father , saying , A boy is born to you ; making him very glad .
16 Let that man be as the cities which Yahweh overthrew , and did n't repent : and let him hear a cry in the morning , and shouting at noontime ;
17 because he did n't kill me from the womb ; and so my mother would have been my grave , and her womb always great .
18 Why did I come out of the womb to see labor and sorrow , that my days should be consumed with shame ?
