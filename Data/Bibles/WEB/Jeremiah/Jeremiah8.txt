1 `` At that time , '' says Yahweh , `` they shall bring out the bones of the kings of Judah , and the bones of his princes , and the bones of the priests , and the bones of the prophets , and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem , out of their graves ;
2 and they shall spread them before the sun , and the moon , and all the army of the sky , which they have loved , and which they have served , and after which they have walked , and which they have sought , and which they have worshiped : they shall not be gathered , nor be buried , they shall be for dung on the surface of the earth .
3 Death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue that remain of this evil family , that remain in all the places where I have driven them , '' says Yahweh of Armies .
4 `` Moreover you shall tell them , 'Yahweh says : `` 'Shall men fall , and not rise up again ? Shall one turn away , and not return ?
5 Why then have the people of Jerusalem fallen back by a perpetual backsliding ? They cling to deceit , they refuse to return .
6 I listened and heard , but they did n't say what is right . No one repents of his wickedness , saying , `` What have I done ? '' Everyone turns to his course , as a horse that rushes headlong in the battle .
7 Yes , the stork in the sky knows her appointed times ; and the turtledove , the swallow , and the crane observe the time of their coming ; but my people do n't know Yahweh 's law .
8 `` 'How do you say , `` We are wise , and Yahweh 's law is with us ? '' But , behold , the false pen of the scribes has worked falsely .
9 The wise men are disappointed . They are dismayed and trapped . Behold , they have rejected Yahweh 's word . What kind of wisdom is in them ?
10 Therefore will I give their wives to others , and their fields to those who shall possess them . For everyone from the least even to the greatest is given to covetousness ; from the prophet even to the priest everyone deals falsely .
11 They have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly , saying , `` Peace , peace , '' when there is no peace .
12 Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination ? No , they were not at all ashamed , neither could they blush : therefore they shall fall among those who fall ; in the time of their visitation they shall be cast down , says Yahweh .
13 `` 'I will utterly consume them , says Yahweh : no grapes shall be on the vine , nor figs on the fig tree , and the leaf shall fade ; and the things that I have given them shall pass away from them . ' ''
14 `` Why do we sit still ? Assemble yourselves , and let us enter into the fortified cities , and let us be silent there ; for Yahweh our God has put us to silence , and given us water of gall to drink , because we have sinned against Yahweh .
15 We looked for peace , but no good came ; and for a time of healing , and behold , dismay !
16 The snorting of his horses is heard from Dan : at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones the whole land trembles ; for they have come , and have devoured the land and all that is in it ; the city and those who dwell therein . ''
17 `` For , behold , I will send serpents , adders among you , which will not be charmed ; and they shall bite you , '' says Yahweh .
18 Oh that I could comfort myself against sorrow ! My heart is faint within me .
19 Behold , the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people from a land that is very far off : `` Is n't Yahweh in Zion ? Is n't her King in her ? '' `` Why have they provoked me to anger with their engraved images , and with foreign vanities ? ''
20 `` The harvest is past , the summer is ended , and we are not saved . ''
21 For the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt : I mourn ; dismay has taken hold on me .
22 Is there no balm in Gilead ? is there no physician there ? Why then is n't the health of the daughter of my people recovered ?
