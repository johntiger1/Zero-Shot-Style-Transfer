1 Jotham was twenty-five years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Jerushah the daughter of Zadok .
2 He did that which was right in Yahweh 's eyes , according to all that his father Uzziah had done : however he did n't enter into Yahweh 's temple . The people still did corruptly .
3 He built the upper gate of Yahweh 's house , and on the wall of Ophel he built much .
4 Moreover he built cities in the hill country of Judah , and in the forests he built fortresses and towers .
5 He fought also with the king of the children of Ammon , and prevailed against them . The children of Ammon gave him the same year one hundred talents of silver , and ten thousand cors of wheat , and ten thousand cors of barley . The children of Ammon gave that much to him in the second year also , and in the third .
6 So Jotham became mighty , because he ordered his ways before Yahweh his God .
7 Now the rest of the acts of Jotham , and all his wars , and his ways , behold , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah .
8 He was five and twenty years old when he began to reign , and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem .
9 Jotham slept with his fathers , and they buried him in David 's city : and Ahaz his son reigned in his place .
