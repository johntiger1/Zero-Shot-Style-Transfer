1 Joash was seven years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Zibiah , of Beersheba .
2 Joash did that which was right in Yahweh 's eyes all the days of Jehoiada the priest .
3 Jehoiada took for him two wives ; and he became the father of sons and daughters .
4 After this , Joash intended to restore Yahweh 's house .
5 He gathered together the priests and the Levites , and said to them , `` Go out to the cities of Judah , and gather money to repair the house of your God from all Israel from year to year . See that you expedite this matter . '' However the Levites did n't do it right away .
6 The king called for Jehoiada the chief , and said to him , `` Why have n't you required of the Levites to bring in the tax of Moses the servant of Yahweh , and of the assembly of Israel , out of Judah and out of Jerusalem , for the tent of the testimony ? ''
7 For the sons of Athaliah , that wicked woman , had broken up God 's house ; and they also gave all the dedicated things of Yahweh 's house to the Baals .
8 So the king commanded , and they made a chest , and set it outside at the gate of Yahweh 's house .
9 They made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem , to bring in for Yahweh the tax that Moses the servant of God laid on Israel in the wilderness .
10 All the princes and all the people rejoiced , and brought in , and cast into the chest , until they had made an end .
11 It was so , that whenever the chest was brought to the king 's officers by the hand of the Levites , and when they saw that there was much money , the king 's scribe and the chief priest 's officer came and emptied the chest , and took it , and carried it to its place again . Thus they did day by day , and gathered money in abundance .
12 The king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of Yahweh 's house ; and they hired masons and carpenters to restore Yahweh 's house , and also such as worked iron and brass to repair Yahweh 's house .
13 So the workmen worked , and the work of repairing went forward in their hands , and they set up God 's house in its state , and strengthened it .
14 When they had made an end , they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada , of which were made vessels for Yahweh 's house , even vessels with which to minister and to offer , and spoons , and vessels of gold and silver . They offered burnt offerings in Yahweh 's house continually all the days of Jehoiada .
15 But Jehoiada grew old and was full of days , and he died ; one hundred thirty years old was he when he died .
16 They buried him in David 's city among the kings , because he had done good in Israel , and toward God and his house .
17 Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah , and made obeisance to the king . Then the king listened to them .
18 They abandoned the house of Yahweh , the God of their fathers , and served the Asherah poles and the idols ; and wrath came on Judah and Jerusalem for this their guiltiness .
19 Yet he sent prophets to them , to bring them again to Yahweh ; and they testified against them : but they would not give ear .
20 The Spirit of God came on Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest ; and he stood above the people , and said to them , `` Thus says God , 'Why do you disobey Yahweh 's commandments , so that you ca n't prosper ? Because you have forsaken Yahweh , he has also forsaken you . ' ''
21 They conspired against him , and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of Yahweh 's house .
22 Thus Joash the king did n't remember the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him , but killed his son . When he died , he said , `` May Yahweh look at it , and repay it . ''
23 At the end of the year , the army of the Syrians came up against him : and they came to Judah and Jerusalem , and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people , and sent all their plunder to the king of Damascus .
24 For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men ; and Yahweh delivered a very great army into their hand , because they had forsaken Yahweh , the God of their fathers . So they executed judgment on Joash .
25 When they were departed for him ( for they left him very sick ) , his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest , and killed him on his bed , and he died ; and they buried him in David 's city , but they did n't bury him in the tombs of the kings .
26 These are those who conspired against him : Zabad the son of Shimeath the Ammonitess , and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith the Moabitess .
27 Now concerning his sons , and the greatness of the burdens laid on him , and the rebuilding of God 's house , behold , they are written in the commentary of the book of the kings . Amaziah his son reigned in his place .
