1 At that time , Judah went down from his brothers , and visited a certain Adullamite , whose name was Hirah .
2 Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite whose name was Shua . He took her , and went in to her .
3 She conceived , and bore a son ; and he named him Er .
4 She conceived again , and bore a son ; and she named him Onan .
5 She yet again bore a son , and named him Shelah : and he was at Chezib , when she bore him .
6 Judah took a wife for Er , his firstborn , and her name was Tamar .
7 Er , Judah 's firstborn , was wicked in Yahweh 's sight . Yahweh killed him .
8 Judah said to Onan , `` Go in to your brother 's wife , and perform the duty of a husband 's brother to her , and raise up offspring forl your brother . ''
9 Onan knew that the offspring would n't be his ; and when he went in to his brother 's wife , he spilled it on the ground , lest he should give offspring to his brother .
10 The thing which he did was evil in Yahweh 's sight , and he killed him also .
11 Then Judah said to Tamar , his daughter-in-law , `` Remain a widow in your father 's house , until Shelah , my son , is grown up '' ; for he said , `` Lest he also die , like his brothers . '' Tamar went and lived in her father 's house .
12 After many days , Shua 's daughter , the wife of Judah , died . Judah was comforted , and went up to his sheep shearers to Timnah , he and his friend Hirah , the Adullamite .
13 Tamar was told , `` Behold , your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep . ''
14 She took off of her the garments of her widowhood , and covered herself with her veil , and wrapped herself , and sat in the gate of Enaim , which is by the way to Timnah ; for she saw that Shelah was grown up , and she was n't given to him as a wife .
15 When Judah saw her , he thought that she was a prostitute , for she had covered her face .
16 He turned to her by the way , and said , `` Please come , let me come in to you , '' for he did n't know that she was his daughter-in-law . She said , `` What will you give me , that you may come in to me ? ''
17 He said , `` I will send you a young goat from the flock . '' She said , `` Will you give me a pledge , until you send it ? ''
18 He said , `` What pledge will I give you ? '' She said , `` Your signet and your cord , and your staff that is in your hand . '' He gave them to her , and came in to her , and she conceived by him .
19 She arose , and went away , and put off her veil from her , and put on the garments of her widowhood .
20 Judah sent the young goat by the hand of his friend , the Adullamite , to receive the pledge from the woman 's hand , but he did n't find her .
21 Then he asked the men of her place , saying , `` Where is the prostitute , that was at Enaim by the road ? '' They said , `` There has been no prostitute here . ''
22 He returned to Judah , and said , `` I have n't found her ; and also the men of the place said , 'There has been no prostitute here . ' ''
23 Judah said , `` Let her keep it , lest we be shamed . Behold , I sent this young goat , and you have n't found her . ''
24 About three months later , Judah was told , `` Tamar , your daughter-in-law , has played the prostitute . Moreover , behold , she is with child by prostitution . '' Judah said , `` Bring her out , and let her be burnt . ''
25 When she was brought out , she sent to her father-in-law , saying , `` By the man , whose these are , I am with child . '' She also said , `` Please discern whose are theseâ€”the signet , and the cords , and the staff . ''
26 Judah acknowledged them , and said , `` She is more righteous than I , because I did n't give her to Shelah , my son . '' He knew her again no more .
27 In the time of her travail , behold , twins were in her womb .
28 When she travailed , one put out a hand , and the midwife took and tied a scarlet thread on his hand , saying , `` This came out first . ''
29 As he drew back his hand , behold , his brother came out , and she said , `` Why have you made a breach for yourself ? '' Therefore his name was called Perez .
30 Afterward his brother came out , that had the scarlet thread on his hand , and his name was called Zerah .
