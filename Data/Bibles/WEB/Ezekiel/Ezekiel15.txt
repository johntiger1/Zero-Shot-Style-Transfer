1 Yahweh 's word came to me , saying ,
2 Son of man , what is the vine tree more than any tree , the vine-branch which is among the trees of the forest ?
3 Will wood be taken of it to make anything ? Will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel on it ?
4 Behold , it is cast into the fire for fuel ; the fire has devoured both its ends , and the middle of it is burned : is it profitable for any work ?
5 Behold , when it was whole , it was meet for no work : how much less , when the fire has devoured it , and it is burned , shall it yet be meet for any work !
6 Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh : As the vine tree among the trees of the forest , which I have given to the fire for fuel , so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem .
7 I will set my face against them ; they shall go out from the fire , but the fire shall devour them ; and you shall know that I am Yahweh , when I set my face against them .
8 I will make the land desolate , because they have committed a trespass , says the Lord Yahweh .
