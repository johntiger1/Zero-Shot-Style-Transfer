1 The children of Israel traveled , and encamped in the plains of Moab beyond the Jordan at Jericho .
2 Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites .
3 Moab was very afraid of the people , because they were many . Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel .
4 Moab said to the elders of Midian , `` Now this multitude will lick up all that is around us , as the ox licks up the grass of the field . '' Balak the son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time .
5 He sent messengers to Balaam the son of Beor , to Pethor , which is by the River , to the land of the children of his people , to call him , saying , `` Behold , there is a people who came out of Egypt . Behold , they cover the surface of the earth , and they are staying opposite me .
6 Please come now therefore curse me this people ; for they are too mighty for me . Perhaps I shall prevail , that we may strike them , and that I may drive them out of the land ; for I know that he whom you bless is blessed , and he whom you curse is cursed . ''
7 The elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand . They came to Balaam , and spoke to him the words of Balak .
8 He said to them , `` Lodge here this night , and I will bring you word again , as Yahweh shall speak to me . '' The princes of Moab stayed with Balaam .
9 God came to Balaam , and said , `` Who are these men with you ? ''
10 Balaam said to God , `` Balak the son of Zippor , king of Moab , has said to me ,
11 'Behold , the people that has come out of Egypt covers the surface of the earth . Now , come curse me them . Perhaps I shall be able to fight against them , and shall drive them out . ' ''
12 God said to Balaam , `` You shall not go with them . You shall not curse the people ; for they are blessed . ''
13 Balaam rose up in the morning , and said to the princes of Balak , `` Go to your land ; for Yahweh refuses to permit me to go with you . ''
14 The princes of Moab rose up , and they went to Balak , and said , `` Balaam refuses to come with us . ''
15 Balak again sent princes , more , and more honorable than they .
16 They came to Balaam , and said to him , `` Thus says Balak the son of Zippor , 'Please let nothing hinder you from coming to me ,
17 for I will promote you to very great honor , and whatever you say to me I will do . Please come therefore , and curse this people for me . ' ''
18 Balaam answered the servants of Balak , `` If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold , I ca n't go beyond the word of Yahweh my God , to do less or more .
19 Now therefore , please wait also here this night , that I may know what Yahweh will speak to me more . ''
20 God came to Balaam at night , and said to him , `` If the men have come to call you , rise up , go with them ; but only the word which I speak to you , that you shall do . ''
21 Balaam rose up in the morning , and saddled his donkey , and went with the princes of Moab .
22 God 's anger burned because he went ; and Yahweh 's angel placed himself in the way for an adversary against him . Now he was riding on his donkey , and his two servants were with him .
23 The donkey saw Yahweh 's angel standing in the way , with his sword drawn in his hand ; and the donkey turned aside out of the way , and went into the field . Balaam struck the donkey , to turn her into the way .
24 Then Yahweh 's angel stood in a narrow path between the vineyards , a wall being on this side , and a wall on that side .
25 The donkey saw Yahweh 's angel , and she thrust herself to the wall , and crushed Balaam 's foot against the wall . He struck her again .
26 Yahweh 's angel went further , and stood in a narrow place , where there was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left .
27 The donkey saw Yahweh 's angel , and she lay down under Balaam . Balaam 's anger burned , and he struck the donkey with his staff .
28 Yahweh opened the mouth of the donkey , and she said to Balaam , `` What have I done to you , that you have struck me these three times ? ''
29 Balaam said to the donkey , `` Because you have mocked me , I wish there were a sword in my hand , for now I would have killed you . ''
30 The donkey said to Balaam , `` Am I not your donkey , on which you have ridden all your life long until today ? Was I ever in the habit of doing so to you ? '' He said , `` No . ''
31 Then Yahweh opened the eyes of Balaam , and he saw Yahweh 's angel standing in the way , with his sword drawn in his hand ; and he bowed his head , and fell on his face .
32 Yahweh 's angel said to him , `` Why have you struck your donkey these three times ? Behold , I have come out as an adversary , because your way is perverse before me .
33 The donkey saw me , and turned aside before me these three times . Unless she had turned aside from me , surely now I would have killed you , and saved her alive . ''
34 Balaam said to Yahweh 's angel , `` I have sinned ; for I did n't know that you stood in the way against me . Now therefore , if it displeases you , I will go back again . ''
35 Yahweh 's angel said to Balaam , `` Go with the men ; but only the word that I shall speak to you , that you shall speak . '' So Balaam went with the princes of Balak .
36 When Balak heard that Balaam had come , he went out to meet him to the City of Moab , which is on the border of the Arnon , which is in the utmost part of the border .
37 Balak said to Balaam , `` Did n't I earnestly send to you to call you ? Why did n't you come to me ? Am I not able indeed to promote you to honor ? ''
38 Balaam said to Balak , `` Behold , I have come to you . Have I now any power at all to speak anything ? The word that God puts in my mouth , that shall I speak . ''
39 Balaam went with Balak , and they came to Kiriath Huzoth .
40 Balak sacrificed cattle and sheep , and sent to Balaam , and to the princes who were with him .
41 In the morning , Balak took Balaam , and brought him up into the high places of Baal ; and he saw from there part of the people .
