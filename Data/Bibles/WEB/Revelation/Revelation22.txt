1 He showed me a river of water of life , clear as crystal , proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb ,
2 in the middle of its street . On this side of the river and on that was the tree of life , bearing twelve kinds of fruits , yielding its fruit every month . The leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations .
3 There will be no curse any more . The throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it , and his servants serve him .
4 They will see his face , and his name will be on their foreheads .
5 There will be no night , and they need no lamp light ; for the Lord God will illuminate them . They will reign forever and ever .
6 He said to me , `` These words are faithful and true . The Lord God of the spirits of the prophets sent his angel to show to his bondservants the things which must happen soon . ''
7 `` Behold , I come quickly . Blessed is he who keeps the words of the prophecy of this book . ''
8 Now I , John , am the one who heard and saw these things . When I heard and saw , I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel who had shown me these things .
9 He said to me , `` See you do n't do it ! I am a fellow bondservant with you and with your brothers , the prophets , and with those who keep the words of this book . Worship God . ''
10 He said to me , `` Do n't seal up the words of the prophecy of this book , for the time is at hand .
11 He who acts unjustly , let him act unjustly still . He who is filthy , let him be filthy still . He who is righteous , let him do righteousness still . He who is holy , let him be holy still . ''
12 `` Behold , I come quickly . My reward is with me , to repay to each man according to his work .
13 I am the Alpha and the Omega , the First and the Last , the Beginning and the End .
14 Blessed are those who do his commandments , that they may have the right to the tree of life , and may enter in by the gates into the city .
15 Outside are the dogs , the sorcerers , the sexually immoral , the murderers , the idolaters , and everyone who loves and practices falsehood .
