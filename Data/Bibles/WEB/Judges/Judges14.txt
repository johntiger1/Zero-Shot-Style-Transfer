1 Samson went down to Timnah , and saw a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines .
2 He came up , and told his father and his mother , and said , `` I have seen a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines . Now therefore get her for me as my wife . ''
3 Then his father and his mother said to him , `` Is n't there a woman among your brothers ' daughters , or among all my people , that you go to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines ? '' Samson said to his father , `` Get her for me , for she pleases me well . ''
4 But his father and his mother did n't know that it was of Yahweh ; for he sought an occasion against the Philistines . Now at that time the Philistines ruled over Israel .
5 Then went Samson down with his father and his mother to Timnah , and came to the vineyards of Timnah ; and behold , a young lion roared against him .
6 Yahweh 's Spirit came mightily on him , and he tore him as he would have torn a young goat ; and he had nothing in his hand , but he did n't tell his father or his mother what he had done .
7 He went down , and talked with the woman , and she pleased Samson well .
8 After a while he returned to take her ; and he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion ; and behold , there was a swarm of bees in the body of the lion , and honey .
9 He took it into his hands , and went on , eating as he went . He came to his father and mother , and gave to them , and they ate , but he did n't tell them that he had taken the honey out of the lion 's body .
10 His father went down to the woman : and Samson made a feast there ; for so the young men used to do .
11 When they saw him , they brought thirty companions to be with him .
12 Samson said to them , `` Let me tell you a riddle now . If you can declare it to me within the seven days of the feast , and find it out , then I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothing ;
13 but if you ca n't declare it to me , then you shall give me thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothing . '' They said to him , `` Tell us your riddle , that we may hear it . ''
14 He said to them , `` Out of the eater came out food . Out of the strong came out sweetness . '' They could n't in three days declare the riddle .
15 On the seventh day , they said to Samson 's wife , `` Entice your husband , that he may declare to us the riddle , lest we burn you and your father 's house with fire . Have you called us to impoverish us ? Is n't that so ? ''
16 Samson 's wife wept before him , and said , `` You just hate me , and do n't love me . You 've told a riddle to the children of my people , and have n't told it to me . '' He said to her , `` Behold , I have n't told my father or my mother , so why should I tell you ? ''
17 She wept before him the seven days , while their feast lasted ; and on the seventh day , he told her , because she pressed him severely ; and she told the riddle to the children of her people .
18 The men of the city said to him on the seventh day before the sun went down , `` What is sweeter than honey ? What is stronger than a lion ? '' He said to them , `` If you had n't plowed with my heifer , you would n't have found out my riddle . ''
19 Yahweh 's Spirit came mightily on him , and he went down to Ashkelon , and struck thirty men of them , and took their plunder , then gave the changes of clothing to those who declared the riddle . His anger burned , and he went up to his father 's house .
20 But Samson 's wife was given to his companion who had been his friend .
