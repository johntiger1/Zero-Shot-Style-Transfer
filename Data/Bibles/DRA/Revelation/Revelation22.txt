1 And he shewed me a river of water of life , clear as crystal , proceeding from the throne of God and of the Lamb .
2 In the midst of the street thereof , and on both sides of the river , was the tree of life , bearing twelve fruits , yielding its fruits every month , and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations .
3 And there shall be no curse any more ; but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it , and his servants shall serve him .
4 And they shall see his face : and his name shall be on their foreheads .
5 And night shall be no more : and they shall not need the light of the lamp , nor the light of the sun , because the Lord God shall enlighten them , and they shall reign for ever and ever .
6 And he said to me : These words are most faithful and true . And the Lord God of the spirits of the prophets sent his angel to shew his servants the things which must be done shortly .
7 And , Behold I come quickly . Blessed is he that keepeth the words of the prophecy of this book .
8 And I , John , who have heard and seen these things . And after I had heard and seen , I fell down to adore before the feet of the angel , who shewed me these things .
9 And he said to me : See thou do it not : for I am thy fellow servant , and of thy brethren the prophets , and of them that keep the words of the prophecy of this book . Adore God .
10 And he saith to me : Seal not the words of the prophecy of this book : for the time is at hand .
11 He that hurteth , let him hurt still : and he that is filthy , let him be filthy still : and he that is just , let him be justified still : and he that is holy , let him be sanctified still .
12 Behold , I come quickly ; and my reward is with me , to render to every man according to his works .
13 I am Alpha and Omega , the first and the last , the beginning and the end .
14 Blessed are they that wash their robes in the blood of the Lamb : that they may have a right to the tree of life , and may enter in by the gates into the city .
15 Without are dogs , and sorcerers , and unchaste , and murderers , and servers of idols , and every one that loveth and maketh a lie .
