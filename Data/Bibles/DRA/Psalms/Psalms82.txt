1 A canticle of a psalm for Asaph .
2 O God , who shall be like to thee ? hold not thy peace , neither be thou still , O God .
3 For lo , thy enemies have made a noise : and they that hate thee have lifted up the head .
4 They have taken a malicious counsel against thy people , and have consulted against thy saints .
5 They have said : Come and let us destroy them , so that they be not a nation : and let the name of Israel be remembered no more .
6 For they have contrived with one consent : they have made a covenant together against thee ,
7 The tabernacles of the Edomites , and the Ismahelites : Moab , and the Agarens ,
8 Gebal , and Ammon and Amalec : the Philistines , with the inhabitants of Tyre .
