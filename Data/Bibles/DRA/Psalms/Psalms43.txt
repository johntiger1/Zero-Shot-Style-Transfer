1 Unto the end , for the sons of Core , to give understanding .
2 We have heard , O God , with our ears : our fathers have declared to us , The work , thou hast wrought in their days , and in the days of old .
3 Thy hand destroyed the Gentiles , and thou plantedst them : thou didst afflict the people and cast them out .
4 For they got not the possession of the land by their own sword : neither did their own arm save them . But thy right hand and thy arm , and the light of thy countenance : because thou wast pleased with them .
5 Thou art thyself my king and my God , who commandest the saving of Jacob .
