1 Understanding for Asaph . Attend , O my people , to my law : incline your ears to the words of my mouth .
2 I will open my mouth in parables : I will utter propositions from the beginning .
3 How great things have we heard and known , and our fathers have told us .
4 They have not been hidden from their children , in another generation . Declaring the praises of the Lord , and his powers , and his wonders which he hath done .
5 And he set up a testimony in Jacob : and made a law in Israel . How great things he commanded our fathers , that they should make the same known to their children :
6 That another generation might know them . The children that should be born and should rise up , and declare them to their children .
7 That they may put their hope in God and may not forget the works of God : and may seek his commandments .
8 That they may not become like their fathers , a perverse and exasperating generation . A generation that set not their heart aright : and whose spirit was not faithful to God .
9 The sons of Ephraim who bend and shoot with the bow : they have turned back in the day of battle .
10 They kept not the covenant of God : and in his law they would not walk .
11 And they forgot his benefits , and his wonders that he had shewn them .
12 Wonderful things did he do in the sight of their fathers , in the land of Egypt , in the field of Tanis .
13 He divided the sea and brought them through : and he made the waters to stand as in a vessel .
14 And he conducted them with a cloud by day : and all the night with a light of fire .
15 He struck the rock in the wilderness : and gave them to drink , as out of the great deep .
16 He brought forth water out of the rock : and made streams run down as rivers .
17 And they added yet more sin against him : they provoked the most High to wrath in the place without water .
18 And they tempted God in their hearts , by asking meat for their desires .
19 And they spoke ill of God : they said : Can God furnish a table in the wilderness ?
20 Because he struck the rock , and the waters gushed out , and the streams overflowed . Can he also give bread , or provide a table for his people ?
