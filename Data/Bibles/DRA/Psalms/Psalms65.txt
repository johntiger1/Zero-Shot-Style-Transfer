1 Unto the end , a canticle of a psalm of the resurrection . Shout with joy to God , all the earth ,
2 Sing ye a psalm to his name ; give glory to his praise .
3 Say unto God , How terrible are thy works , O Lord ! in the multitude of thy strength thy enemies shall lie to thee .
4 Let all the earth adore thee , and sing to thee : let it sing a psalm to thy name .
5 Come and see the works of God ; who is terrible in his counsels over the sons of men .
6 Who turneth the sea into dry land , in the river they shall pass on foot : there shall we rejoice in him .
7 Who by his power ruleth for ever : his eyes behold the nations ; let not them that provoke him he exalted in themselves .
8 O bless our God , ye Gentiles : and make the voice of his praise to be heard .
9 Who hath set my soul to live : and hath not suffered my feet to be moved :
10 For thou , O God , hast proved us : thou hast tried us by fire , as silver is tried .
11 Thou hast brought us into a net , thou hast laid afflictions on our back :
12 Thou hast set men over our heads . We have passed through fire and water , and thou hast brought us out into a refreshment .
13 I will go into thy house with burnt offerings : I will pay thee my vows ,
