1 A psalm for David himself . Mercy and judgment I will sing to thee , O Lord : I will sing ,
2 And I will understand in the unspotted way , when thou shalt come to me . I walked in the innocence of my heart , in the midst of my house .
3 I did not set before my eyes any unjust thing : I hated the workers of iniquities .
4 The perverse heart did not cleave to me : and the malignant , that turned aside from me , I would not know .
5 The man that in private detracted his neighbour , him did I persecute . With him that had a proud eye , and an unsatiable heart , I would not eat .
