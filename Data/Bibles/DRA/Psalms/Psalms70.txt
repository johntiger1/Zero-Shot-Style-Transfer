1 A psalm for David . Of the sons of Jonadab , and the former captives . In thee , O Lord , I have hoped , let me never be put to confusion :
2 Deliver me in thy justice , and rescue me . Incline thy ear unto me , and save me .
3 Be thou unto me a God , a protector , and a place of strength : that thou mayst make me safe . For thou art my firmament and my refuge .
4 Deliver me , O my God , out of the hand of the sinner , and out of the hand of the transgressor of the law and of the unjust .
5 For thou art my patience , O Lord : my hope , O Lord , from my youth ;
