1 The Lord is the God to whom revenge belongeth : the God of revenge hath acted freely .
2 Lift up thyself , thou that judgest the earth : render a reward to the proud .
3 How long shall sinners , O Lord : how long shall sinners glory ?
4 Shall they utter , and speak iniquity : shall all speak who work injustice ?
5 Thy people , O Lord , they have brought low : and they have afflicted thy inheritance .
