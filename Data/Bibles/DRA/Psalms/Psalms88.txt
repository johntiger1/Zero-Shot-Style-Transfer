1 Of understanding , for Ethan the Ezrahite .
2 The mercies of the Lord I will sing for ever . I will shew forth thy truth with my mouth to generation and generation .
3 For thou hast said : Mercy shall be built up for ever in the heavens : thy truth shall be prepared in them .
4 I have made a covenant with my elect : I have sworn to David my servant :
5 Thy seed will I settle for ever . And I will build up thy throne unto generation and generation .
6 The heavens shall confess thy wonders , O Lord : and thy truth in the church of the saints .
7 For who in the clouds can be compared to the Lord : or who among the sons of God shall be like to God ?
8 God , who is glorified in the assembly of the saints : great and terrible above all them that are about him .
9 O Lord God of hosts , who is like to thee ? thou art mighty , O Lord , and thy truth is round about thee .
10 Thou rulest the power of the sea : and appeasest the motion of the waves thereof .
11 Thou hast humbled the proud one , as one that is slain : with the arm of thy strength thou hast scattered thy enemies .
12 Thine are the heavens , and thine is the earth : the world and the fulness thereof thou hast founded :
13 The north and the sea thou hast created . Thabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy name :
14 Thy arm is with might . Let thy hand be strengthened , and thy right hand exalted :
15 Justice and judgment are the preparation of thy throne . Mercy and truth shall go before thy face :
16 Blessed is the people that knoweth jubilation . They shall walk , O Lord , in the light of thy countenance :
17 And in thy name they shall rejoice all the day , and in thy justice they shall be exalted .
18 For thou art the glory of their strength : and in thy good pleasure shall our horn be exalted .
