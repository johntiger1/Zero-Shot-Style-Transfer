1 I will extol thee , O God my king : and I will bless thy name for ever ; yea , for ever and ever .
2 Every day I will bless thee : and I will praise thy name for ever ; yea , for ever and ever .
3 Great is the Lord , and greatly to be praised : and of his greatness there is no end .
4 Generation and generation shall praise thy works : and they shall declare thy power .
5 They shall speak of the magnificence of the glory of thy holiness : and shall tell thy wondrous works .
6 And they shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts : and shall declare thy greatness .
7 They shall publish the memory of the abundance of thy sweetness : and shall rejoice in thy justice .
8 The Lord is gracious and merciful : patient and plenteous in mercy .
9 The Lord is sweet to all : and his tender mercies are over all his works .
10 Let all thy works , O lord , praise thee : and let thy saints bless thee .
11 They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom : and shall tell of thy power :
12 To make thy might known to the sons of men : and the glory of the magnificence of thy kingdom .
13 Thy kingdom is a kingdom of all ages : and thy dominion endureth throughout all generations . The Lord is faithful in all his words : and holy in all his works .
14 The Lord lifteth up all that fall : and setteth up all that are cast down .
15 The eyes of all hope in thee , O Lord : and thou givest them meat in due season .
