1 Hear , O Lord , my prayer : give ear to my supplication in thy truth : hear me in thy justice .
2 And enter not into judgment with thy servant : for in thy sight no man living shall be justified .
3 For the enemy hath persecuted my soul : he hath brought down my life to the earth . He hath made me to dwell in darkness as those that have been dead of old :
4 And my spirit is in anguish within me : my heart within me is troubled .
5 I remembered the days of old , I meditated on all thy works : I meditated upon the works of thy hands .
6 I stretched forth my hands to thee : my soul is as earth without water unto thee .
7 Hear me speedily , O Lord : my spirit hath fainted away . Turn not away thy face from me , lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit .
