1 Unto the end , a psalm for David .
2 O God , be not thou silent in my praise : for the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful man is opened against me .
3 They have spoken against me with deceitful tongues ; and they have compassed me about with words of hatred ; and have fought against me without cause .
4 Instead of making me a return of love , they detracted me : but I gave myself to prayer .
5 And they repaid me evil for good : and hatred for my love .
6 Set thou the sinner over him : and may the devil stand at his right hand .
7 When he is judged , may he go out condemned ; and may his prayer be turned to sin .
8 May his days be few : and his bishopric let another take .
9 May his children be fatherless , and his wife a widow .
10 Let his children be carried about vagabonds , and beg ; and let them be cast out of their dwellings .
11 May the usurer search all his substance : and let strangers plunder his labours .
12 May there be none to help him : nor none to pity his fatherless offspring .
13 May his posterity be cut off ; in one generation may his name be blotted out .
