1 Unto the end , for the morning protection , a psalm for David .
2 O God my God , look upon me : why hast thou forsaken me ? Far from my salvation are the words of my sins .
3 O my God , I shall cry by day , and thou wilt not hear : and by night , and it shall not be reputed as folly in me .
4 But thou dwellest in the holy place , the praise of Israel .
5 In thee have our fathers hoped : they have hoped , and thou hast delivered them .
6 They cried to thee , and they were saved : they trusted in thee , and were not confounded .
7 But I am a worm , and no man : the reproach of men , and the outcast of the people .
8 All they that saw me have laughed me to scorn : they have spoken with the lips , and wagged the head .
9 He hoped in the Lord , let him deliver him : let him save him , seeing he delighteth in him .
10 For thou art he that hast drawn me out of the womb : my hope from the breasts of my mother .
11 I was cast upon thee from the womb . From my mother 's womb thou art my God ,
12 Depart not from me . For tribulation is very near : for there is none to help me .
13 Many calves have surrounded me : fat bulls have besieged me .
