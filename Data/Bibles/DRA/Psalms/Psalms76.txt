1 Unto the end , for Idithun , a psalm of Asaph .
2 I cried to the Lord with my voice ; to God with my voice , and he gave ear to me .
3 In the day of my trouble I sought God , with my hands lifted up to him in the night , and I was not deceived . My soul refused to be comforted :
4 I remembered God , and was delighted , and was exercised , and my spirit swooned away .
5 My eyes prevented the watches : I was troubled , and I spoke not .
6 I thought upon the days of old : and I had in my mind the eternal years .
7 And I meditated in the night with my own heart : and I was exercised and I swept my spirit .
8 Will God then cast off for ever ? or will he never be more favourable again ?
9 Or will he cut off his mercy for ever , from generation to generation ?
10 Or will God forget to shew mercy ? or will he in his anger shut up his mercies ?
11 And I said , Now have I begun : this is the change of the right hand of the most High .
12 I remembered the works of the Lord : for I will be mindful of thy wonders from the beginning .
