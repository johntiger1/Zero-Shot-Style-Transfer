1 Unto the end , a psalm of a canticle for David himself .
2 Let God arise , and let his enemies be scattered : and let them that hate him flee from before his face .
3 As smoke vanisheth , so let them vanish away : as wax melteth before the fire , so let the wicked perish at the presence of God .
4 And let the just feast , and rejoice before God : and be delighted with gladness .
5 Sing ye to God , sing a psalm to his name , make a way for him who ascendeth upon the west : the Lord is his name . Rejoice ye before him : but the wicked shall be troubled at his presence ,
6 Who is the father of orphans , and the judge of widows . God in his holy place :
7 God who maketh men of one manner to dwell in a house : Who bringeth out them that were bound in strength ; in like manner them that provoke , that dwell in sepulchres .
