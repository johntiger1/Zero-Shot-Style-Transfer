1 Unto the end , In verses , understanding for David .
2 When the men of Ziph had come and said to Saul : Is not David hidden with us ?
3 Save me , O God , by thy name , and judge me in thy strength .
4 O God , hear my prayer : give ear to the words of my mouth .
5 For strangers have risen up against me ; and the mighty have sought after my soul : and they have not set God before their eyes .
6 For behold God is my helper : and the Lord is the protector of my soul .
