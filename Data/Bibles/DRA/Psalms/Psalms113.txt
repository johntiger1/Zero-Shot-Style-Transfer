1 When Israel went out of Egypt , the house of Jacob from a barbarous people :
2 Judea made his sanctuary , Israel his dominion .
3 The sea saw and fled : Jordan was turned back .
4 The mountains skipped like rams , and the hills like the lambs of the flock .
5 What ailed thee , O thou sea , that thou didst flee : and thou , O Jordan , that thou wast turned back ?
6 Ye mountains , that ye skipped like rams , and ye hills , like lambs of the flock ?
7 At the presence of the Lord the earth was moved , at the presence of the God of Jacob :
8 Who turned the rock into pools of water , and the stony hill into fountains of waters .
9 Not to us , O Lord , not to us ; but to thy name give glory .
