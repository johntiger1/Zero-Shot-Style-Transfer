1 Unto the end , a psalm for the sons of Core .
2 Hear these things , all ye nations : give ear , all ye inhabitants of the world .
3 All you that are earthborn , and you sons of men : both rich and poor together .
4 My mouth shall speak wisdom : and the meditation of my heart understanding .
5 I will incline my ear to a parable ; I will open my proposition on the psaltery .
6 Why shall I fear in the evil day ? the iniquity of my heel shall encompass me .
7 They that trust in their own strength , and glory in the multitude of their riches ,
8 No brother can redeem , nor shall man redeem : he shall not give to God his ransom ,
9 Nor the price of the redemption of his soul : and shall labour for ever ,
10 And shall still live unto the end .
11 He shall not see destruction , when he shall see the wise dying : the senseless and the fool shall perish together : And they shall leave their riches to strangers :
12 And their sepulchres shall be their houses for ever . Their dwelling places to all generations : they have called their lands by their names .
13 And man when he was in honour did not understand ; he is compared to senseless beasts , and is become like to them .
14 This way of theirs is a stumblingblock to them : and afterwards they shall delight in their mouth .
