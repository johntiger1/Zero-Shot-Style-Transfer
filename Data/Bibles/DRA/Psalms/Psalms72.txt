1 A psalm for Asaph . How good is God to Israel , to them that are of a right heart !
2 But my feet were almost moved ; my steps had well nigh slipped .
3 Because I had a zeal on occasion of the wicked , seeing the prosperity of sinners .
4 For there is no regard to their death , nor is there strength in their stripes .
5 They are not in the labour of men : neither shall they be scourged like other men .
6 Therefore pride hath held them fast : they are covered with their iniquity and their wickedness .
7 Their iniquity hath come forth , as it were from fatness : they have passed into the affection of the heart .
8 They have thought and spoken wickedness : they have spoken iniquity on high .
9 They have set their mouth against heaven : and their tongue hath passed through the earth .
10 Therefore will my people return here and full days shall be found in them .
11 And they said : How doth God know ? and is there knowledge in the most High ?
12 Behold these are sinners ; and yet abounding in the world they have obtained riches .
13 And I said : Then have I in vain justified my heart , and washed my hands among the innocent .
14 And I have been scourged all the day ; and my chastisement hath been in the mornings .
15 If I said : I will speak thus ; behold I should condemn the generation of thy children .
16 I studied that I might know this thing , it is a labour in my sight :
17 Until I go into the sanctuary of God , and understand concerning their last ends .
18 But indeed for deceits thou hast put it to them : when they were lifted up thou hast cast them down .
19 How are they brought to desolation ? they have suddenly ceased to be : they have perished by reason of their iniquity .
20 As the dream of them that awake , O Lord ; so in thy city thou shalt bring their image to nothing .
