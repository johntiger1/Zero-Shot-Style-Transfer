1 A canticle of a psalm for the sons of Core : unto the end , for Maheleth , to answer understanding of Eman the Ezrahite .
2 O Lord , the God of my salvation : I have cried in the day , and in the night before thee .
3 Let my prayer come in before thee : incline thy ear to my petition .
4 For my soul is filled with evils : and my life hath drawn nigh to hell .
5 I am counted among them that go down to the pit : I am become as a man without help ,
6 Free among the dead . Like the slain sleeping in the sepulchres , whom thou rememberest no more : and they are cast off from thy hand .
7 They have laid me in the lower pit : in the dark places , and in the shadow of death .
