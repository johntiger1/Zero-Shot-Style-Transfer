1 On the first day of the week , a psalm for David . The earth is the Lord 's and the fulness thereof : the world , and all they that dwell therein .
2 For he hath founded it upon the seas ; and hath prepared it upon the rivers .
3 Who shall ascend into the mountain of the Lord : or who shall stand in his holy place ?
4 The innocent in hands , and clean of heart , who hath not taken his soul in vain , nor sworn deceitfully to his neighbour .
5 He shall receive a blessing from the Lord , and mercy from God his Saviour .
6 This is the generation of them that seek him , of them that seek the face of the God of Jacob .
