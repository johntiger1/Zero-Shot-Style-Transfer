1 Often have they fought against me from my youth , let Israel now say .
2 Often have they fought against me from my youth : but they could not prevail over me .
3 The wicked have wrought upon my back : they have lengthened their iniquity .
4 The Lord who is just will cut the necks of sinners :
5 Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Sion .
6 Let them be as grass on the tops of houses : which withered before it be plucked up :
