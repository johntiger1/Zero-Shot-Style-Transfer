1 Unto the end , for David the servant of the Lord , who spoke to the Lord the words of this canticle , in the day that the Lord delivered him from the hands of all his enemies , and from the hand of Saul . [ 2 Kings 22 . ]
2 I will love thee , O Lord , my strength :
3 The Lord is my firmament , my refuge , and my deliverer . My God is my helper , and in him will I put my trust . My protector and the horn of my salvation , and my support .
4 Praising I will call upon the Lord : and I shall be saved from my enemies .
5 The sorrows of death surrounded me : and the torrents of iniquity troubled me .
6 The sorrows of hell encompassed me : and the snares of death prevented me .
7 In my affliction I called upon the Lord , and I cried to my God : And he heard my voice from his holy temple : and my cry before him came into his ears .
8 The earth shook and trembled : the foundations of the mountains were troubled and were moved , because he was angry with them .
9 There went up a smoke in his wrath : and a fire flamed from his face : coals were kindled by it .
10 He bowed the heavens , and came down : and darkness was under his feet .
11 And he ascended upon the cherubim , and he flew ; he flew upon the wings of the winds .
12 And he made darkness his covert , his pavilion round about him : dark waters in the clouds of the air .
13 At the brightness that was before him the clouds passed , hail and coals of fire .
14 And the Lord thundered from heaven , and the highest gave his voice : hail and coals of fire .
15 And he sent forth his arrows , and he scattered them : he multiplied lightnings , and troubled them .
