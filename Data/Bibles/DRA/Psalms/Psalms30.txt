1 Unto the end , a psalm for David , in an ecstasy .
2 In thee , O Lord , have I hoped , let me never be confounded : deliver me in thy justice .
3 Bow down thy ear to me : make haste to deliver me . Be thou unto me a God , a protector , and a house of refuge , to save me .
4 For thou art my strength and my refuge ; and for thy name 's sake thou wilt lead me , and nourish me .
5 Thou wilt bring me out of this snare , which they have hidden for me : for thou art my protector .
6 Into thy hands I commend my spirit : thou hast redeemed me , O Lord , the God of truth .
7 Thou hast hated them that regard vanities , to no purpose . But I have hoped in the Lord :
8 I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy . For thou hast regarded my humility , thou hast saved my soul out of distresses .
9 And thou hast not shut me up in the hands of the enemy : thou hast set my feet in a spacious place .
10 Have mercy on me , O Lord , for I am afflicted : my eye is troubled with wrath , my soul , and my belly :
11 For my life is wasted with grief : and my years in sighs . My strength is weakened through poverty and my bones are disturbed .
12 I am become a reproach among all my enemies , and very much to my neighbours ; and a fear to my acquaintance . They that saw me without fled from me .
