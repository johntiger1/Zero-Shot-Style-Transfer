1 The inscription of a title to David himself . Preserve me , O Lord , for I have put trust in thee .
2 I have said to the Lord , thou art my God , for thou hast no need of my goods .
3 To the saints , who are in his land , he hath made wonderful all my desires in them .
4 Their infirmities were multiplied : afterwards they made haste . I will not gather together their meetings for blood offerings : nor will I be mindful of their names by my lips .
5 The Lord is the portion of my inheritance and of my cup : it is thou that wilt restore my inheritance to me .
