1 A psalm of a canticle , for the sons of Core , on the second day of the week .
2 Great is the Lord , and exceedingly to be praised in the city of our God , in his holy mountain .
3 With the joy of the whole earth is mount Sion founded , on the sides of the north , the city of the great king .
4 In her houses shall God be known , when he shall protect her .
5 For behold the kings of the earth assembled themselves : they gathered together .
6 So they saw , and they wondered , they were troubled , they were moved :
7 Trembling took hold of them . There were pains as of a woman in labour .
8 With a vehement wind thou shalt break in pieces the ships of Tharsis .
9 As we have heard , so have we seen , in the city of the Lord of hosts , in the city of our God : God hath founded it for ever .
