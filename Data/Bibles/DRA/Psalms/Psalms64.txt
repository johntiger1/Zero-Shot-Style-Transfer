1 To the end , a psalm of David . The canticle of Jeremias and Ezechiel to the people of the captivity , when they began to go out .
2 A Hymn , O God , becometh thee in Sion : and a vow shall be paid to thee in Jerusalem .
3 O hear my prayer : all flesh shall come to thee .
4 The words of the wicked have prevailed over us : and thou wilt pardon our transgressions .
5 Blessed is he whom thou hast chosen and taken to thee : he shall dwell in thy courts . We shall be filled with the good things of thy house ; holy is thy temple ,
6 Wonderful in justice . Hear us , O God our saviour , who art the hope of all the ends of the earth , and in the sea afar off .
7 Thou who preparest the mountains by thy strength , being girded with power :
8 Who troublest the depth of the sea , the noise of its waves . The Gentiles shall be troubled ,
9 And they that dwell in the uttermost borders shall be afraid at thy signs : thou shalt make the outgoings of the morning and of the evening to be joyful .
10 Thou hast visited the earth , and hast plentifully watered it ; thou hast many ways enriched it . The river of God is filled with water , thou hast prepared their food : for so is its preparation .
