1 A psalm for David . Rejoice in the Lord , O ye just : praise becometh the upright .
2 Give praise to the Lord on the harp ; sing to him with the psaltery , the instrument of ten strings .
3 Sing to him a new canticle , sing well unto him with a loud noise .
4 For the word of the Lord is right , and all his works are done with faithfulness .
5 He loveth mercy and judgment ; the earth is full of the mercy of the Lord .
6 By the word of the Lord the heavens were established ; and all the power of them by the spirit of his mouth :
7 Gathering together the waters of the sea , as in a vessel ; laying up the depths in storehouses .
8 Let all the earth fear the Lord , and let all the inhabitants of the world be in awe of him .
9 For he spoke and they were made : he commanded and they were created .
10 The Lord bringeth to naught the counsels of nations ; and he rejecteth the devices of people , and casteth away the counsels of princes .
11 But the counsel of the Lord standeth for ever : the thoughts of his heart to all generations .
