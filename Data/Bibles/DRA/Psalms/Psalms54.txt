1 Unto the end , in verses , understanding for David .
2 Hear , O God , my prayer , and despise not my supplication :
3 Be attentive to me and hear me . I am grieved in my exercise ; and am troubled ,
4 At the voice of the enemy , and at the tribulation of the sinner . For they have cast iniquities upon me : and in wrath they were troublesome to me .
5 My heart is troubled within me : and the fear of death is fallen upon me .
6 Fear and trembling are come upon me : and darkness hath covered me .
7 And I said : Who will give me wings like a dove , and I will fly and be at rest ?
