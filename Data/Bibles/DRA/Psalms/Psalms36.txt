1 A psalm for David himself . Be not emulous of evildoers ; nor envy them that work iniquity .
2 For they shall shortly wither away as grass , and as the green herbs shall quickly fall .
3 Trust in the Lord , and do good , and dwell in the land , and thou shalt be fed with its riches .
4 Delight in the Lord , and he will give thee the requests of thy heart .
5 Commit thy way to the Lord , and trust in him , and he will do it .
6 And he will bring forth thy justice as the light , and thy judgment as the noonday .
7 Be subject to the Lord and pray to him Envy not the man who prospereth in his way ; the man who doth unjust things .
8 Cease from anger , and leave rage ; have no emulation to do evil .
9 For the evildoers shall be cut off : but they that wait upon the Lord shall inherit the land .
10 For yet a little while , and the wicked shall not be : and thou shalt seek his place , and shalt not find it .
11 But the meek shall inherit the land , and shall delight in abundance of peace .
12 The sinner shall watch the just man : and shall gnash upon him with his teeth .
