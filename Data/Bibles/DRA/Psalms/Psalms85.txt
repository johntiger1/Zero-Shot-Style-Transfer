1 A prayer for David himself . Incline thy ear , O Lord , and hear me : for I am needy and poor .
2 Preserve my soul , for I am holy : save thy servant , O my God , that trusteth in thee .
3 Have mercy on me , O Lord , for I have cried to thee all the day .
4 Give joy to the soul of thy servant , for to thee , O Lord , I have lifted up my soul .
5 For thou , O Lord , art sweet and mild : and plenteous in mercy to all that call upon thee .
6 Give ear , O Lord , to my prayer : and attend to the voice of my petition .
7 I have called upon thee in the day of my trouble : because thou hast heard me .
8 There is none among the gods like unto thee , O Lord : and there is none according to thy works .
9 All the nations thou hast made shall come and adore before thee , O Lord : and they shall glorify thy name .
10 For thou art great and dost wonderful things : thou art God alone .
11 Conduct me , O Lord , in thy way , and I will walk in thy truth : let my heart rejoice that it may fear thy name .
12 I will praise thee , O Lord my God : with my whole heart , and I will glorify thy name for ever :
13 For thy mercy is great towards me : and thou hast delivered my soul out of the lower hell .
