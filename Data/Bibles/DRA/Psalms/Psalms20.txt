1 Unto the end . A psalm for David .
2 In thy strength , O Lord , the king shall joy ; and in thy salvation he shall rejoice exceedingly .
3 Thou hast given him his heart 's desire : and hast not withholden from him the will of his lips .
4 For thou hast prevented him with blessings of sweetness : thou hast set on his head a crown of precious stones .
5 He asked life of thee : and thou hast given him length of days for ever and ever .
6 His glory is great in thy salvation : glory and great beauty shalt thou lay upon him .
7 For thou shalt give him to be a blessing for ever and ever : thou shalt make him joyful in gladness with thy countenance .
8 For the king hopeth in the Lord : and through the mercy of the most High he shall not be moved .
9 Let thy hand be found by all thy enemies : let thy right hand find out all them that hate thee .
