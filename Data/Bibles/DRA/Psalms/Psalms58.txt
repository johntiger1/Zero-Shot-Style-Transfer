1 Unto the end , destroy not , for David for an inscription of It title , when Saul sent and watched his house to kill him .
2 Deliver me from my enemies , O my God ; and defend me from them that rise up against me .
3 Deliver me from them that work iniquity , and save me from bloody men .
4 For behold they have caught my soul : the mighty have rushed in upon me :
5 Neither is it my iniquity , nor my sin , O Lord : without iniquity have I run , and directed my steps .
6 Rise up thou to meet me , and behold : even thou , O Lord , the God of hosts , the God of Israel . Attend to visit all the nations : have no mercy on all them that work iniquity .
7 They shall return at evening , and shall suffer hunger like dogs : and shall go round about the city .
8 Behold they shall speak with their mouth , and a sword is in their lips : for who , say they , hath heard us ?
9 But thou , O Lord , shalt laugh at them : thou shalt bring all the nations to nothing .
10 I will keep my strength to thee : for thou art my protector :
11 My God , his mercy shall prevent me .
