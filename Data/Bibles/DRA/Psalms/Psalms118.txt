1 ALEPH . Blessed are the undefiled in the way , who walk in the law of the Lord .
2 Blessed are they who search his testimonies : that seek him with their whole heart .
3 For they that work iniquity , have not walked in his ways .
4 Thou hast commanded thy commandments to be kept most diligently .
5 O ! that my ways may be directed to keep thy justifications .
6 Then shall I not be confounded , when I shall look into all thy commandments .
7 I will praise thee with uprightness of heart , when I shall have learned the judgments of thy justice .
8 I will keep thy justifications : O ! do not thou utterly forsake me .
9 BETH . By what doth a young man correct his way ? by observing thy words .
10 With my whole heart have I sought after thee : let me not stray from thy commandments .
11 Thy words have I hidden in my heart , that I may not sin against thee .
12 Blessed art thou , O Lord : teach me thy justifications .
13 With my lips I have pronounced all the judgments of thy mouth .
14 I have been delighted in the way of thy testimonies , as in all riches .
15 I will meditate on thy commandments : and I will consider thy ways .
16 I will think of thy justifications : I will not forget thy words .
17 GIMEL . Give bountifully to thy servant , enliven me : and I shall keep thy words .
18 Open thou my eyes : and I will consider the wondrous things of thy law .
19 I am a sojourner on the earth : hide not thy commandments from me .
20 My soul hath coveted to long for thy justifications , at all times .
21 Thou hast rebuked the proud : they are cursed who decline from thy commandments .
22 Remove from reproach and contempt : because I have sought after thy testimonies .
23 For princes sat , and spoke against me : but thy servant was employed in thy justifications .
24 For thy testimonies are my meditation : and thy justifications my counsel .
25 DALETH . My soul hath cleaved to the pavement : quicken thou me according to thy word .
26 I have declared my ways , and thou hast heard me : teach me thy justifications .
27 Make me to understand the way of thy justifications : and I shall be exercised in thy wondrous works .
28 My soul hath slumbered through heaviness : strengthen thou me in thy words .
29 Remove from me the way of iniquity : and out of thy law have mercy on me .
