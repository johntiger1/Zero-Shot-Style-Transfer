1 The prayer of the poor man , when he was anxious , and poured out his supplication before the Lord .
2 Hear , O Lord , my prayer : and let my cry come to thee .
3 Turn not away thy face from me : in the day when I am in trouble , incline thy ear to me . In what day soever I shall call upon thee , hear me speedily .
4 For my days are vanished like smoke : and my bones are grown dry like fuel for the fire .
5 I am smitten as grass , and my heart is withered : because I forgot to eat my bread .
6 Through the voice of my groaning , my bone hath cleaved to my flesh .
7 I am become like to a pelican of the wilderness : I am like a night raven in the house .
8 I have watched , and am become as a sparrow all alone on the housetop .
