1 Lord , thou hast proved me , and known me :
2 Thou hast know my sitting down , and my rising up .
3 Thou hast understood my thoughts afar off : my path and my line thou hast searched out .
4 And thou hast foreseen all my ways : for there is no speech in my tongue .
5 Behold , O Lord , thou hast known all things , the last and those of old : thou hast formed me , and hast laid thy hand upon me .
6 Thy knowledge is become wonderful to me : it is high , and I can not reach to it .
7 Whither shall I go from thy spirit ? or whither shall I flee from thy face ?
8 If I ascend into heaven , thou art there : if I descend into hell , thou art present .
