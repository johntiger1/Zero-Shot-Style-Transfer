1 Unto the end , a psalm for David . To thee , O Lord , have I lifted up my soul .
2 In thee , O my God , I put my trust ; let me not be ashamed .
3 Neither let my enemies laugh at me : for none of them that wait on thee shall be confounded .
4 Let all them be confounded that act unjust things without cause . shew , O Lord , thy ways to me , and teach me thy paths .
5 Direct me in thy truth , and teach me ; for thou art God my Saviour ; and on thee have I waited all the day long .
6 Remember , O Lord , thy bowels of compassion ; and thy mercies that are from the beginning of the world .
7 The sins of my youth and my ignorances do not remember . According to thy mercy remember thou me : for thy goodness ' sake , O Lord .
8 The Lord is sweet and righteous : therefore he will give a law to sinners in the way .
9 He will guide the mild in judgment : he will teach the meek his ways .
10 All the ways of the Lord are mercy and truth , to them that seek after his covenant and his testimonies .
