1 King Nabuchodonosor made a statue of gold , of sixty cubits high , and six cubits broad , and he set it up in the plain of Dura of the province of Babylon .
2 Then Nabuchodonosor the king sent to call together the nobles , the magistrates , and the judges , the captains , the rulers , and governors , and all the chief men of the provinces , to come to the dedication of the statue which king Nabuchodonosor had set up .
3 Then the nobles , the magistrates , and the judges , the captains , and rulers , and the great men that were placed in authority , and all the princes of the provinces , were gathered together to come to the dedication of the statue , which king Nabuchodonosor had set up . And they stood before the statue which king Nabuchodonosor had set up .
4 Then a herald cried with a strong voice : To you it is commanded , O nations , tribes , and languages :
5 That in the hour that you shall hear the sound of the trumpet , and of the flute , and of the harp , of the sackbut , and of the psaltery , and of the symphony , and of all kind of music ; ye fall down and adore the golden statue which king Nabuchodonosor hath set up .
6 But if any man shall not fall down and adore , he shall the same hour be cast into a furnace of burning fire .
7 Upon this therefore , at the time when all the people heard the sound of the trumpet , the flute , and the harp , of the sackbut , and the psaltery , of the symphony , and of all kind of music : all the nations , tribes , and languages fell down and adored the golden statue which king Nabuchodonosor had set up .
8 And presently at that very time some Chaldeans came and accused the Jews ,
9 And said to king Nabuchodonosor : O king , live for ever :
10 Thou , O king , hast made a decree that every man that shall hear the sound of the trumpet , the flute , and the harp , of the sackbut , and the psaltery , of the symphony , and of all kind of music , shall prostrate himself , and adore the golden statue :
11 And that if any man shall not fall down and adore , he should be cast into a furnace of burning fire .
12 Now there are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the works of the province of Babylon , Sidrach , Misach , and Abdenago : these men , O king , have slighted thy decree : they worship not thy gods , nor do they adore the golden statue which thou hast set up .
13 Then Nabuchodonosor in fury , and in wrath , commanded that Sidrach , Misach , and Abdenago should be brought : who immediately were brought before the king .
14 And Nabuchodonosor the king spoke to them , and said : Is it true , O Sidrach , Misach , and Abdenago , that you do not worship my gods , nor adore the golden statue that I have set up ?
15 Now therefore if you be ready at what hour soever you shall hear the sound of the trumpet , flute , harp , sackbut , and psaltery , and symphony , and of all kind of music , prostrate yourselves , and adore the statue which I have made : but if you do not adore , you shall be cast the same hour into the furnace of burning fire : and who is the God that shall deliver you out of my hand ?
16 Sidrach , Misach , and Abdenago answered and said to king Nabuchodonosor : We have no occasion to answer thee concerning this matter .
17 For behold our God , whom we worship , is able to save us from the furnace of burning fire , and to deliver us out of thy hands , O king .
18 But if he will not , be it known to thee , O king , that we will not worship thy gods , nor adore the golden statue which thou hast set up .
19 Then was Nabuchodonosor filled with fury : and the countenance of his face was changed against Sidrach , Misach , and Abdenago , and he commanded that the furnace should be heated seven times more than it had been accustomed to be heated .
20 And he commanded the strongest men that were in his army , to bind the feet of Sidrach , Misach , and Abdenago , and to cast them into the furnace of burning fire .
21 And immediately these men were bound and were cast into the furnace of burning fire , with their coats , and their caps , and their shoes , and their garments .
22 For the king 's commandment was urgent , and the furnace was heated exceedingly . And the flame of the fire slew those men that had cast in Sidrach , Misach , and Abdenago .
23 But these three men , that is , Sidrach , Misach , and Abdenago , fell down bound in the midst of the furnace of burning fire .
24 And they walked in the midst of the flame , praising God and blessing the Lord .
25 Then Azarias standing up prayed in this manner , and opening his mouth in the midst of the fire , he said :
26 Blessed art thou , O Lord , the God of our fathers , and thy name is worthy of praise , and glorious for ever :
27 For thou art just in all that thou hast done to us , and all thy works are true , and thy ways right , and all thy judgments true .
28 For thou hast executed true judgments in all the things that thou hast brought upon us , and upon Jerusalem the holy city of our fathers : for according to truth and judgment , thou hast brought all these things upon us for our sins .
29 For we have sinned , and committed iniquity , departing from thee : and we have trespassed in all things :
30 And we have not hearkened to thy commandments , nor have we observed nor done as thou hadst commanded us , that it might go well with us .
