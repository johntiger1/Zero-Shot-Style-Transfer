1 And in the fifteenth year of the government of Tiberius Caesar -- Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea , and Herod tetrarch of Galilee , and Philip his brother , tetrarch of Ituraea and of the region of Trachonitis , and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene --
2 Annas and Caiaphas being chief priests -- there came a word of God unto John the son of Zacharias , in the wilderness ,
3 and he came to all the region round the Jordan , proclaiming a baptism of reformation -- to remission of sins ,
4 as it hath been written in the scroll of the words of Isaiah the prophet , saying , `A voice of one crying in the wilderness , Prepare ye the way of the Lord , straight make ye His paths ;
5 every valley shall be filled , and every mountain and hill shall be made low , and the crooked shall become straightness , and the rough become smooth ways ;
6 and all flesh shall see the salvation of God . '
7 Then said he to the multitudes coming forth to be baptised by him , `Brood of vipers ! who did prompt you to flee from the coming wrath ?
8 make , therefore , fruits worthy of the reformation , and begin not to say within yourselves , We have a father -- Abraham ; for I say to you , that God is able out of these stones to raise children to Abraham ;
9 and already also the axe unto the root of the trees is laid , every tree , therefore , not making good fruit is cut down , and to fire it is cast . '
10 And the multitudes were questioning him , saying , `What , then , shall we do ? '
11 and he answering saith to them , `He having two coats -- let him impart to him having none , and he having victuals -- in like manner let him do . '
12 And there came also tax-gatherers to be baptised , and they said unto him , `Teacher , what shall we do ? '
13 and he said unto them , `Exact no more than that directed you . '
14 And questioning him also were those warring , saying , `And we , what shall we do ? ' and he said unto them , `Do violence to no one , nor accuse falsely , and be content with your wages . '
15 And the people are looking forward , and all are reasoning in their hearts concerning John , whether or not he may be the Christ ;
16 John answered , saying to all , `I indeed with water do baptise you , but he cometh who is mightier than I , of whom I am not worthy to loose the latchet of his sandals -- he shall baptise you with the Holy Spirit and with fire ;
17 whose winnowing shovel in his hand , and he will thoroughly cleanse his floor , and will gather the wheat to his storehouse , and the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable . '
18 And , therefore , indeed with many other things , exhorting , he was proclaiming good news to the people ,
19 and Herod the tetrarch , being reproved by him concerning Herodias the wife of Philip his brother , and concerning all the evils that Herod did ,
20 added also this to all , that he shut up John in the prison .
21 And it came to pass , in all the people being baptised , Jesus also being baptised , and praying , the heaven was opened ,
22 and the Holy Spirit came down in a bodily appearance , as if a dove , upon him , and a voice came out of heaven , saying , `Thou art My Son -- the Beloved , in thee I did delight . '
23 And Jesus himself was beginning to be about thirty years of age , being , as was supposed , son of Joseph ,
24 the of Eli , the of Matthat , the of Levi , the of Melchi , the of Janna , the of Joseph ,
25 the of Mattathias , the of Amos , the of Naum , the of Esli ,
26 the of Naggai , the of Maath , the of Mattathias , the of Semei , the of Joseph , the of Juda ,
27 the of Joanna , the of Rhesa , the of Zerubbabel , the of Shealtiel ,
28 the of Neri , the of Melchi , the of Addi , the of Cosam , the of Elmodam , the of Er ,
29 the of Jose , the of Eliezer , the of Jorim , the of Matthat ,
30 the of Levi , the of Simeon , the of Juda , the of Joseph , the of Jonan , the of Eliakim ,
31 the of Melea , the of Mainan , the of Mattatha , the of Nathan ,
32 the of David , the of Jesse , the of Obed , the of Booz , the of Salmon , the of Nahshon ,
33 the of Amminadab , the of Aram , the of Esrom , the of Pharez ,
34 the of Judah , the of Jacob , the of Isaac , the of Abraham , the of Terah , the of Nahor ,
35 the of Serug , the of Reu , the of Peleg , the of Eber ,
36 the of Salah , the of Cainan , the of Arphaxad , the of Shem , the of Noah , the of Lamech ,
37 the of Methuselah , the of Enoch , the of Jared , the of Mahalaleel ,
38 the of Cainan , the of Enos , the of Seth , the of Adam , the of God .
