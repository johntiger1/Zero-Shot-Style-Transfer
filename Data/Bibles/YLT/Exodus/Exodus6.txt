4 and also I have established My covenant with them , to give to them the land of Canaan , the land of their sojournings , wherein they have sojourned ;
5 and also I have heard the groaning of the sons of Israel , whom the Egyptians are causing to serve , and I remember My covenant .
6 `Therefore say to the sons of Israel , I Jehovah , and I have brought you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians , and have delivered you from their service , and have redeemed you by a stretched-out arm , and by great judgments ,
7 and have taken you to Me for a people , and I have been to you for God , and ye have known that I Jehovah your God , who is bringing you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians ;
8 and I have brought you in unto the land which I have lifted up My hand to give it to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob , and have given it to you -- a possession ; I Jehovah . '
