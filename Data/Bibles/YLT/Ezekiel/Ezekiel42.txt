1 And he bringeth me forth unto the outer court , the way northward , and he bringeth me in unto the chamber that over-against the separate place , and that over-against the building at the north .
2 At the front of the length a hundred cubits the north opening , and the breadth fifty cubits .
3 Over-against the twenty that are to the inner court , and over-against the pavement that to the outer court , gallery over-against gallery , in the three .
4 And at the front of the chambers a walk of ten cubits in breadth unto the inner part , a way of one cubit , and their openings at the north .
5 And the upper chambers short , for the galleries contain more than these , than the lower , and than the middle one , of the building ;
6 for they threefold , and they have no pillars as the pillars of the court , therefore it hath been kept back -- more than the lower and than the middle one -- from the ground .
7 As to the wall that at the outside , over-against the chambers , the way of the outer-court at the front of the chambers , its length fifty cubits ;
8 for the length of the chambers that to the outer court fifty cubits , and of those on the front of the temple a hundred cubits .
9 And under these chambers the entrance from the east , in one 's going into them from the outer court .
10 In the breadth of the wall of the court eastward , unto the front of the separate place , and unto the front of the building , chambers .
11 And the way before them as the appearance of the chambers that northward , according to their length so their breadth , and all their outlets , and according to their fashions , and according to their openings .
12 And according to the openings of the chambers that southward an opening at the head of the way , the way directly in the front of the wall eastward in entering them .
13 And he saith unto me , `The north chambers , the south chambers , that at the front of the separate place , they holy chambers , where the priests ( who near to Jehovah ) eat the most holy things , there they place the most holy things , and the present , and the sin-offering , and the guilt-offering , for the place holy .
14 In the priests ' going in , they come not out from the sanctuary unto the outer court , and there they place their garments with which they minister , for they holy , and have put on other garments , and have drawn near unto that which for the people . '
15 And he hath finished the measurements of the inner house , and hath brought me forth the way of the gate whose front eastward , and he hath measured it all round about .
16 He hath measured the east side with the measuring-reed , five hundred reeds , with the measuring-reed round about .
17 He hath measured the north side , five hundred reeds , with the measuring reed round about .
18 The south side he hath measured , five hundred reeds , with the measuring-reed .
19 He hath turned round unto the west side , he hath measured five hundred reeds with the measuring-reed .
20 At the four sides he hath measured it , a wall to it all round about , the length five hundred , and the breadth five hundred , to separate between the holy and the profane place .
