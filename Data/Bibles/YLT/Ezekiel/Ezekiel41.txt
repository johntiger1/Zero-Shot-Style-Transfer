1 And he bringeth me in unto the temple , and he measureth the posts , six cubits the breadth on this side , and six cubits the breadth on that side -- the breadth of the tent .
2 And the breadth of the opening ten cubits ; and the sides of the opening five cubits on this side , and five cubits on that side ; and he measureth its length forty cubits , and the breadth twenty cubits .
3 And he hath gone inward , and measureth the post of the opening two cubits , and the opening six cubits , and the breadth of the opening seven cubits .
4 And he measureth its length twenty cubits , and the breadth twenty cubits , unto the front of the temple , and he saith unto me , `This the holy of holies . '
5 And he measureth the wall of the house six cubits , and the breadth of the side-chamber four cubits , all round the house round about .
6 And the side-chambers side-chamber by side-chamber , three and thirty times ; and they are entering into the wall -- which the house hath for the side-chambers all round about -- to be taken hold of , and they are not taken hold of by the wall of the house .
7 And a broad place and a turning place still upwards to the side-chambers , for the turning round of the house still upwards all round about the house : therefore the breadth of the house upwards , and so the lower one goeth up unto the higher by the midst .
8 And I have looked at the house , the height all round about : the foundations of the side-chambers the fulness of the reed , six cubits by the joining .
9 The breadth of the wall that to the side-chamber at the outside five cubits ; and that which is left the place of the side-chambers that to the house .
10 And between the chambers a breadth of twenty cubits round about the house , all round about .
11 And the opening of the side-chamber to the place left , one opening northward , and one opening southward , and the breadth of the place that is left five cubits all round about .
12 As to the building that at the front of the separate place the corner westward , the breadth seventy cubits , and the wall of the building five cubits broad all round about , and its length ninety cubits .
13 And he hath measured the house , the length a hundred cubits ; and the separate place , and the building , and its walls , the length a hundred cubits ;
14 and the breadth of the front of the house , and of the separate place eastward , a hundred cubits .
15 And he hath measured the length of the building unto the front of the separate place that at its hinder part , and its galleries on this side and on that side , a hundred cubits , and the inner temple and the porches of the court ,
16 the thresholds , and the narrow windows , and the galleries round about them three , over-against the threshold , a ceiling of wood all round about , and the ground unto the windows and the covered windows ,
17 over above the opening , and unto the inner-house , and at the outside , and by all the wall all round about within and without measure .
18 And it is made cherubs and palm-trees , and a palm-tree between cherub and cherub , and two faces to the cherub ;
19 and the face of man unto the palm-tree on this side , and the face of a young lion unto the palm-tree on that side ; it is made unto all the house all round about .
20 from the earth unto above the opening the cherubs and the palm-trees made , and the wall of the temple .
21 Of the temple the side post square , and of the front of the sanctuary , the appearance as the appearance .
22 Of the altar , the wood three cubits in height , and its length two cubits ; and its corners to it , and its length , and its walls of wood , and he speaketh unto me , `This the table that before Jehovah . '
23 And two doors to the temple and to the sanctuary ;
24 and two leaves to the doors , two turning leaves to the doors , two to the one door , and two leaves to the other .
25 And made on them , on the doors of the temple , cherubs and palm-trees as are made on the walls , and a thickness of wood at the front of the porch on the outside .
26 And narrow windows and palm-trees on this side , and on that side , at the sides of the porch , and the side-chambers of the house , and the thick places .
