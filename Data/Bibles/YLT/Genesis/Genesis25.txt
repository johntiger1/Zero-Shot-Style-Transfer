1 And Abraham addeth and taketh a wife , and her name Keturah ;
2 and she beareth to him Zimran , and Jokshan , and Medan , and Midian , and Ishbak , and Shuah .
3 And Jokshan hath begotten Sheba and Dedan ; and the sons of Dedan were Asshurim , and Letushim , and Leummim ;
4 and the sons of Midian Ephah , and Epher , and Hanoch , and Abidah , and Eldaah : all these sons of Keturah .
5 And Abraham giveth all that he hath to Isaac ;
6 and to the sons of the concubines whom Abraham hath , Abraham hath given gifts , and sendeth them away from Isaac his son ( in his being yet alive ) eastward , unto the east country .
7 And these the days of the years of the life of Abraham , which he lived , a hundred and seventy and five years ;
8 and Abraham expireth , and dieth in a good old age , aged and satisfied , and is gathered unto his people .
9 And Isaac and Ishmael his sons bury him at the cave of Machpelah , at the field of Ephron , son of Zoar the Hittite , which before Mamre --
10 the field which Abraham bought from the sons of Heth -- there hath Abraham been buried , and Sarah his wife .
11 And it cometh to pass after the death of Abraham , that God blesseth Isaac his son ; and Isaac dwelleth by the Well of the Living One , my Beholder .
12 And these births of Ishmael , Abraham 's son , whom Hagar the Egyptian , Sarah 's handmaid , hath borne to Abraham ;
13 and these the names of the sons of Ishmael , by their names , according to their births : first-born of Ishmael , Nebajoth ; and Kedar , and Adbeel , and Mibsam ,
14 and Mishma , and Dumah , and Massa ,
15 Hadar , and Tema , Jetur , Naphish , and Kedemah :
16 these are sons of Ishmael , and these their names , by their villages , and by their towers ; twelve princes according to their peoples .
17 And these the years of the life of Ishmael , a hundred and thirty and seven years ; and he expireth , and dieth , and is gathered unto his people ;
18 and they tabernacle from Havilah unto Shur , which before Egypt , in going towards Asshur ; in the presence of all his brethren hath he fallen .
19 And these births of Isaac , Abraham 's son : Abraham hath begotten Isaac ;
20 and Isaac is a son of forty years in his taking Rebekah , daughter of Bethuel the Aramaean , from Padan-Aram , sister of Laban the Aramaean , to him for a wife .
21 And Isaac maketh entreaty to Jehovah before his wife , for she barren : and Jehovah is entreated of him , and Rebekah his wife conceiveth ,
22 and the children struggle together within her , and she saith , `If [ it is ] right -- why I thus ? ' and she goeth to seek Jehovah .
23 And Jehovah saith to her , `Two nations in thy womb , and two peoples from thy bowels are parted ; and the people than the people is stronger ; and the elder doth serve the younger . '
24 And her days to bear are fulfilled , and lo , twins in her womb ;
25 and the first cometh out all red as a hairy robe , and they call his name Esau ;
26 and afterwards hath his brother come out , and his hand is taking hold on Esau 's heel , and one calleth his name Jacob ; and Isaac a son of sixty years in her bearing them .
27 And the youths grew , and Esau is a man acquainted hunting , a man of the field ; and Jacob a plain man , inhabiting tents ;
28 and Isaac loveth Esau , for hunting in his mouth ; and Rebekah is loving Jacob .
29 And Jacob boileth pottage , and Esau cometh in from the field , and he weary ;
30 and Esau saith unto Jacob , `Let me eat , I pray thee , some of this red red thing , for I weary ; ' therefore hath called his name Edom ;
31 and Jacob saith , `Sell to-day thy birthright to me . '
32 And Esau saith , `Lo , I am going to die , and what is this to me -- birthright ? '
33 and Jacob saith , `Swear to me to-day : ' and he sweareth to him , and selleth his birthright to Jacob ;
34 and Jacob hath given to Esau bread and pottage of lentiles , and he eateth , and drinketh , and riseth , and goeth ; and Esau despiseth the birthright .
