1 The Song of Songs , that Solomon 's .
2 Let him kiss me with kisses of his mouth , For better thy loves than wine .
3 For fragrance thy perfumes good . Perfume emptied out -- thy name , Therefore have virgins loved thee !
4 Draw me : after thee we run , The king hath brought me into his inner chambers , We do joy and rejoice in thee , We mention thy loves more than wine , Uprightly they have loved thee !
5 Dark I , and comely , daughters of Jerusalem , As tents of Kedar , as curtains of Solomon .
6 Fear me not , because I very dark , Because the sun hath scorched me , The sons of my mother were angry with me , They made me keeper of the vineyards , My vineyard -- my own -- I have not kept .
7 Declare to me , thou whom my soul hath loved , Where thou delightest , Where thou liest down at noon , For why am I as one veiled , By the ranks of thy companions ?
8 If thou knowest not , O fair among women , Get thee forth by the traces of the flock , And feed thy kids by the shepherds ' dwellings !
9 To my joyous one in chariots of Pharaoh , I have compared thee , my friend ,
10 Comely have been thy cheeks with garlands , Thy neck with chains .
11 Garlands of gold we do make for thee , With studs of silver !
12 While the king in his circle , My spikenard hath given its fragrance .
13 A bundle of myrrh my beloved to me , Between my breasts it lodgeth .
14 A cluster of cypress my beloved to me , In the vineyards of En-Gedi !
15 Lo , thou fair , my friend , Lo , thou fair , thine eyes doves !
16 Lo , thou fair , my love , yea , pleasant , Yea , our couch green ,
17 The beams of our houses cedars , Our rafters firs , I a rose of Sharon , a lily of the valleys !
