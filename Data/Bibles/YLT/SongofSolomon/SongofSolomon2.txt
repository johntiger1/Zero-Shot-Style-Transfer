1 As a lily among the thorns ,
2 So my friend among the daughters !
3 As a citron among trees of the forest , So my beloved among the sons , In his shade I delighted , and sat down , And his fruit sweet to my palate .
4 He hath brought me in unto a house of wine , And his banner over me love ,
5 Sustain me with grape-cakes , Support me with citrons , for I sick with love .
6 His left hand under my head , And his right doth embrace me .
7 I have adjured you , daughters of Jerusalem , By the roes or by the hinds of the field , Stir not up nor wake the love till she please !
8 The voice of my beloved ! lo , this -- he is coming , Leaping on the mountains , skipping on the hills .
9 My beloved like to a roe , Or to a young one of the harts . Lo , this -- he is standing behind our wall , Looking from the windows , Blooming from the lattice .
10 My beloved hath answered and said to me , `Rise up , my friend , my fair one , and come away ,
11 For lo , the winter hath passed by , The rain hath passed away -- it hath gone .
12 The flowers have appeared in the earth , The time of the singing hath come , And the voice of the turtle was heard in our land ,
13 The fig-tree hath ripened her green figs , And the sweet-smelling vines have given forth fragrance , Rise , come , my friend , my fair one , yea , come away .
14 My dove , in clefts of the rock , In a secret place of the ascent , Cause me to see thine appearance , Cause me to hear thy voice , For thy voice sweet , and thy appearance comely .
15 Seize ye for us foxes , Little foxes -- destroyers of vineyards , Even our sweet-smelling vineyards .
16 My beloved mine , and I his , Who is delighting among the lilies ,
17 Till the day doth break forth , And the shadows have fled away , Turn , be like , my beloved , To a roe , or to a young one of the harts , On the mountains of separation !
