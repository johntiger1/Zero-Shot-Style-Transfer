1 Praise ye Jah ! I thank Jehovah with the whole heart , In the secret meeting of the upright , And of the company .
2 Great the works of Jehovah , Sought out by all desiring them .
3 Honourable and majestic is His work , And His righteousness is standing for ever .
4 A memorial He hath made of His wonders , Gracious and merciful Jehovah .
5 Prey He hath given to those fearing Him , He remembereth to the age His covenant .
6 The power of His works He hath declared to His people , To give to them the inheritance of nations .
7 The works of His hands true and just , Stedfast all His appointments .
8 They are sustained for ever to the age . They are made in truth and uprightness .
9 Redemption He hath sent to His people , He hath appointed to the age His covenant , Holy and fearful His name .
10 The beginning of wisdom fear of Jehovah , Good understanding have all doing them , His praise standing for ever !
