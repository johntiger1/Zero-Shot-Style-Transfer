1 Give ye thanks to Jehovah , For good , for to the age His kindness .
2 I pray you , let Israel say , That , to the age His kindness .
3 I pray you , let the house of Aaron say , That , to the age His kindness .
4 I pray you , let those fearing Jehovah say , That , to the age His kindness .
5 From the straitness I called Jah , Jah answered me in a broad place .
6 Jehovah for me , I do not fear what man doth to me .
7 Jehovah for me among my helpers , And I -- I look on those hating me .
8 Better to take refuge in Jehovah than to trust in man ,
9 Better to take refuge in Jehovah , Than to trust in princes .
10 All nations have compassed me about , In the name of Jehovah I surely cut them off .
11 They have compassed me about , Yea , they have compassed me about , In the name of Jehovah I surely cut them off .
12 They compassed me about as bees , They have been extinguished as a fire of thorns , In the name of Jehovah I surely cut them off .
13 Thou hast sorely thrust me to fall , And Jehovah hath helped me .
14 My strength and song Jah , And He is to me for salvation .
15 A voice of singing and salvation , in the tents of the righteous , The right hand of Jehovah is doing valiantly .
16 The right hand of Jehovah is exalted , The right hand of Jehovah is doing valiantly .
17 I do not die , but live , And recount the works of Jah ,
18 Jah hath sorely chastened me , And to death hath not given me up .
19 Open ye to me gates of righteousness , I enter into them -- I thank Jah .
20 This the gate to Jehovah , The righteous enter into it .
21 I thank Thee , for Thou hast answered me , And art to me for salvation .
22 A stone the builders refused Hath become head of a corner .
23 From Jehovah hath this been , It wonderful in our eyes ,
24 This the day Jehovah hath made , We rejoice and are glad in it .
25 I beseech Thee , O Jehovah , save , I pray Thee , I beseech Thee , O Jehovah , prosper , I pray Thee .
26 Blessed he who is coming In the name of Jehovah , We blessed you from the house of Jehovah ,
27 God Jehovah , and He giveth to us light , Direct ye the festal-sacrifice with cords , Unto the horns of the altar .
28 My God Thou , and I confess Thee , My God , I exalt Thee .
29 Give ye thanks to Jehovah , For good , for to the age , His kindness !
