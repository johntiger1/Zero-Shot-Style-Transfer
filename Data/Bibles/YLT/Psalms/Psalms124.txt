1 A Song of the Ascents , by David . Save Jehovah -- who hath been for us , ( Pray , let Israel say ) ,
2 Save Jehovah -- who hath been for us , In the rising up of man against us ,
3 Then alive they had swallowed us up , In the burning of their anger against us ,
4 Then the waters had overflowed us , The stream passed over our soul ,
5 Then passed over our soul had the proud waters .
6 Blessed Jehovah who hath not given us , A prey to their teeth .
7 Our soul as a bird hath escaped from a snare of fowlers , The snare was broken , and we have escaped .
8 Our help in the name of Jehovah , Maker of the heavens and earth !
