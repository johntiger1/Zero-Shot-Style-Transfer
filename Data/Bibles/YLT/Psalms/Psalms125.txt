1 A Song of the Ascents . Those trusting in Jehovah as Mount Zion , It is not moved -- to the age it abideth .
2 Jerusalem ! mountains round about her , And Jehovah round about His people , From henceforth even unto the age .
3 For the rod of wickedness resteth not On the lot of the righteous , That the righteous put not forth on iniquity their hands .
4 Do good , O Jehovah , to the good , And to the upright in their hearts .
5 As to those turning their crooked ways , Jehovah causeth them to go with workers of iniquity . Peace on Israel !
