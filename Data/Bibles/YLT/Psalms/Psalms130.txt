1 A Song of the Ascents . From depths I have called Thee , Jehovah .
2 Lord , hearken to my voice , Thine ears are attentive to the voice of my supplications .
3 If iniquities Thou dost observe , O Lord , who doth stand ?
4 But with Thee forgiveness , that Thou mayest be feared .
5 I hoped Jehovah -- hoped hath my soul , And for His word I have waited .
6 My soul for the Lord , More than those watching for morning , Watching for morning !
7 Israel doth wait on Jehovah , For with Jehovah kindness , And abundant with Him redemption .
8 And He doth redeem Israel from all his iniquities !
