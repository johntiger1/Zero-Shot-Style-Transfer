1 Come , we sing to Jehovah , We shout to the rock of our salvation .
2 We come before His face with thanksgiving , With psalms we shout to Him .
3 For a great God Jehovah , And a great king over all gods .
4 In whose hand the deep places of earth , And the strong places of hills His .
5 Whose is the sea , and He made it , And His hands formed the dry land .
6 Come in , we bow ourselves , and we bend , We kneel before Jehovah our Maker .
7 For He our God , and we the people of His pasture , And the flock of His hand , To-day , if to His voice ye hearken ,
8 Harden not your heart as Meribah , As the day of Massah in the wilderness ,
9 Where your fathers have tried Me , Have proved Me , yea , have seen My work .
10 Forty years I am weary of the generation , And I say , `A people erring in heart -- they ! And they have not known My ways : '
11 Where I sware in Mine anger , `If they come in unto My rest -- ! '
