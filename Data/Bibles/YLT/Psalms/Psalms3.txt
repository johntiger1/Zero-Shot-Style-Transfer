1 A Psalm of David , in his fleeing from the face of Absalom his son . Jehovah , how have my distresses multiplied ! Many are rising up against me .
2 Many are saying of my soul , `There is no salvation for him in God . ' Selah .
3 And Thou , O Jehovah , a shield for me , My honour , and lifter up of my head .
4 My voice unto Jehovah : I call : And He answereth me from his holy hill , Selah .
5 I -- I have lain down , and I sleep , I have waked , for Jehovah sustaineth me .
6 I am not afraid of myriads of people , That round about they have set against me .
7 Rise , O Jehovah ! save me , my God . Because Thou hast smitten All mine enemies the cheek . The teeth of the wicked Thou hast broken .
8 Of Jehovah this salvation ; On Thy people Thy blessing ! Selah .
