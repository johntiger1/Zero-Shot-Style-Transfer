1 To the Overseer , to Jeduthun . -- A Psalm of David . I have said , `I observe my ways , Against sinning with my tongue , I keep for my mouth a curb , while the wicked before me . '
2 I was dumb silence , I kept silent from good , and my pain is excited .
3 Hot my heart within me , In my meditating doth the fire burn , I have spoken with my tongue .
4 `Cause me to know , O Jehovah , mine end , And the measure of my days -- what it , ' I know how frail I .
5 Lo , handbreadths Thou hast made my days , And mine age as nothing before Thee , Only , all vanity every man set up . Selah .
6 Only , in an image doth each walk habitually , Only , vain , they are disquieted , He heapeth up and knoweth not who gathereth them .
7 And , now , what have I expected ? O Lord , my hope -- it of Thee .
8 From all my transgressions deliver me , A reproach of the fool make me not .
9 I have been dumb , I open not my mouth , Because Thou -- Thou hast done .
10 Turn aside from off me Thy stroke , From the striving of Thy hand I have been consumed .
11 With reproofs against iniquity , Thou hast corrected man , And dost waste as a moth his desirableness , Only , vanity every man . Selah .
12 Hear my prayer , O Jehovah , And my cry give ear , Unto my tear be not silent , For a sojourner I with Thee , A settler like all my fathers .
13 Look from me , and I brighten up before I go and am not !
