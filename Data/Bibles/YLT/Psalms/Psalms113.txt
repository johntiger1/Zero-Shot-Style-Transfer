1 Praise ye Jah ! Praise , ye servants of Jehovah . Praise the name of Jehovah .
2 The name of Jehovah is blessed , From henceforth , and unto the age .
3 From the rising of the sun unto its going in , Praised the name of Jehovah .
4 High above all nations Jehovah , Above the heavens his honour .
5 Who as Jehovah our God , He is exalting to sit ?
6 He is humbling to look On the heavens and on the earth .
7 He is raising up from the dust the poor , From a dunghill He exalteth the needy .
8 To cause to sit with princes , With the princes of His people .
9 Causing the barren one of the house to sit , A joyful mother of sons ; praise ye Jah !
