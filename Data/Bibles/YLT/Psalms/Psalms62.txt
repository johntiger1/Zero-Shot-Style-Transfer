1 To the Overseer , for Jeduthun . -- A Psalm of David . Only -- toward God my soul silent , From Him my salvation .
2 Only -- He my rock , and my salvation , My tower , I am not much moved .
3 Till when do ye devise mischief against a man ? Ye are destroyed all of you , As a wall inclined , a hedge that is cast down .
4 Only -- from his excellency They have consulted to drive away , They enjoy a lie , with their mouth they bless , And with their heart revile . Selah .
5 Only -- for God , be silent , O my soul , For from Him my hope .
6 Only -- He my rock and my salvation , My tower , I am not moved .
7 On God my salvation , and my honour , The rock of my strength , my refuge in God .
8 Trust in Him at all times , O people , Pour forth before Him your heart , God a refuge for us . Selah .
9 Only -- vanity the low , a lie the high . In balances to go up they than vanity lighter .
10 Trust not in oppression , And in robbery become not vain , Wealth -- when it increaseth -- set not the heart .
11 Once hath God spoken , twice I heard this , That `strength with God . '
12 And with Thee , O Lord , kindness , For Thou dost recompense to each , According to his work !
