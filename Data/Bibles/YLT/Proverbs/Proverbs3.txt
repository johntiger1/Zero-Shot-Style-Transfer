1 My son ! my law forget not , And my commands let thy heart keep ,
2 For length of days and years , Life and peace they do add to thee .
3 Let not kindness and truth forsake thee , Bind them on thy neck , Write them on the tablet of thy heart ,
4 And find grace and good understanding In the eyes of God and man .
5 Trust unto Jehovah with all thy heart , And unto thine own understanding lean not .
6 In all thy ways know thou Him , And He doth make straight thy paths .
7 Be not wise in thine own eyes , Fear Jehovah , and turn aside from evil .
8 Healing it is to thy navel , And moistening to thy bones .
9 Honour Jehovah from thy substance , And from the beginning of all thine increase ;
10 And filled are thy barns plenty , And new wine thy presses break forth .
11 Chastisement of Jehovah , my son , despise not , And be not vexed with His reproof ,
12 For whom Jehovah loveth He reproveth , Even as a father the son He is pleased with .
13 O the happiness of a man hath found wisdom , And of a man bringeth forth understanding .
14 For better her merchandise Than the merchandise of silver , And than gold -- her increase .
15 Precious she above rubies , And all thy pleasures are not comparable to her .
16 Length of days in her right hand , In her left wealth and honour .
17 Her ways ways of pleasantness , And all her paths peace .
18 A tree of life she to those laying hold on her , And whoso is retaining her happy .
19 Jehovah by wisdom did found the earth , He prepared the heavens by understanding .
20 By His knowledge depths have been rent , And clouds do drop dew .
21 My son ! let them not turn from thine eyes , Keep thou wisdom and thoughtfulness ,
22 And they are life to thy soul , and grace to thy neck .
23 Then thou goest thy way confidently , And thy foot doth not stumble .
24 If thou liest down , thou art not afraid , Yea , thou hast lain down , And sweet hath been thy sleep .
25 Be not afraid of sudden fear , And of the desolation of the wicked when it cometh .
26 For Jehovah is at thy side , And He hath kept thy foot from capture .
27 Withhold not good from its owners , When thy hand toward God to do .
28 Say not thou to thy friend , `Go , and return , and to-morrow I give , ' And substance with thee .
29 Devise not against thy neighbour evil , And he sitting confidently with thee .
30 Strive not with a man without cause , If he have not done thee evil .
31 Be not envious of a man of violence , Nor fix thou on any of his ways .
32 For an abomination to Jehovah the perverted , And with the upright His secret counsel .
33 The curse of Jehovah in the house of the wicked . And the habitation of the righteous He blesseth .
34 If the scorners He doth scorn , Yet to the humble He doth give grace .
35 Honour do the wise inherit , And fools are bearing away shame !
