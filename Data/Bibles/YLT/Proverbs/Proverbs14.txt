1 Every wise woman hath builded her house , And the foolish with her hands breaketh it down .
2 Whoso is walking in his uprightness is fearing Jehovah , And the perverted his ways is despising Him .
3 In the mouth of a fool a rod of pride , And the lips of the wise preserve them .
4 Without oxen a stall clean , And great the increase by the power of the ox .
5 A faithful witness lieth not , And a false witness breatheth out lies .
6 A scorner hath sought wisdom , and it is not , And knowledge to the intelligent easy .
7 Go from before a foolish man , Or thou hast not known the lips of knowledge .
8 The wisdom of the prudent to understand his way , And the folly of fools deceit .
9 Fools mock at a guilt-offering , And among the upright -- a pleasing thing .
10 The heart knoweth its own bitterness , And with its joy a stranger doth not intermeddle .
11 The house of the wicked is destroyed , And the tent of the upright flourisheth .
12 There is a way -- right before a man , And its latter end ways of death .
13 Even in laughter is the heart pained , And the latter end of joy affliction .
14 From his ways is the backslider in heart filled , And a good man -- from his fruits .
15 The simple giveth credence to everything , And the prudent attendeth to his step .
16 The wise is fearing and turning from evil , And a fool is transgressing and is confident .
17 Whoso is short of temper doth folly , And a man of wicked devices is hated .
18 The simple have inherited folly , And the prudent are crowned knowledge .
19 The evil have bowed down before the good , And the wicked at the gates of the righteous .
20 Even of his neighbour is the poor hated , And those loving the rich many .
21 Whoso is despising his neighbour sinneth , Whoso is favouring the humble , O his happiness .
22 Do not they err who are devising evil ? And kindness and truth to those devising good ,
23 In all labour there is advantage , And a thing of the lips only to want .
24 The crown of the wise is their wealth , The folly of fools folly .
25 A true witness is delivering souls , And a deceitful one breatheth out lies .
26 In the fear of Jehovah strong confidence , And to His sons there is a refuge .
27 The fear of Jehovah a fountain of life , To turn aside from snares of death .
28 In the multitude of a people the honour of a king , And in lack of people the ruin of a prince .
29 Whoso is slow to anger of great understanding , And whoso is short in temper is exalting folly .
30 A healed heart life to the flesh , And rottenness to the bones envy .
31 An oppressor of the poor reproacheth his Maker , And whoso is honouring Him Is favouring the needy .
32 In his wickedness is the wicked driven away , And trustful in his death the righteous .
33 In the heart of the intelligent wisdom doth rest . And in the midst of fools it is known .
34 Righteousness exalteth a nation , And the goodliness of peoples a sin-offering .
35 The favour of a king to a wise servant , And an object of his wrath is one causing shame !
