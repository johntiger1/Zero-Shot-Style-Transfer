1 Boast not thyself of to-morrow , For thou knowest not what a day bringeth forth .
2 Let another praise thee , and not thine own mouth , A stranger , and not thine own lips .
3 A stone heavy , and the sand heavy , And the anger of a fool Is heavier than they both .
4 Fury fierce , and anger overflowing , And who standeth before jealousy ?
5 Better open reproof than hidden love .
6 Faithful are the wounds of a lover , And abundant the kisses of an enemy .
7 A satiated soul treadeth down a honeycomb , And a hungry soul every bitter thing sweet .
8 As a bird wandering from her nest , So a man wandering from his place .
9 Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart , And the sweetness of one 's friend -- from counsel of the soul .
10 Thine own friend , and the friend of thy father , forsake not , And the house of thy brother enter not In a day of thy calamity , Better a near neighbour than a brother afar off .
11 Be wise , my son , and rejoice my heart . And I return my reproacher a word .
12 The prudent hath seen the evil , he is hidden , The simple have passed on , they are punished .
13 Take his garment , when a stranger hath been surety , And for a strange woman pledge it .
14 Whoso is saluting his friend with a loud voice , In the morning rising early , A light thing it is reckoned to him .
15 A continual dropping in a day of rain , And a woman of contentions are alike ,
16 Whoso is hiding her hath hidden the wind , And the ointment of his right hand calleth out .
17 Iron by iron is sharpened , And a man sharpens the face of his friend .
18 The keeper of a fig-tree eateth its fruit , And the preserver of his master is honoured .
19 As water the face to face , So the heart of man to man .
20 Sheol and destruction are not satisfied , And the eyes of man are not satisfied .
21 A refining pot for silver , and a furnace for gold , And a man according to his praise .
22 If thou dost beat the foolish in a mortar , Among washed things -- with a pestle , His folly turneth not aside from off him .
23 Know well the face of thy flock , Set thy heart to the droves ,
24 For riches not to the age , Nor a crown to generation and generation .
25 Revealed was the hay , and seen the tender grass , And gathered the herbs of mountains .
26 Lambs for thy clothing , And the price of the field he-goats ,
27 And a sufficiency of goats ' milk for thy bread , For bread to thy house , and life to thy damsels !
