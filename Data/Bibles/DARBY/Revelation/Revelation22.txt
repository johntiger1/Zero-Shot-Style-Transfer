1 And he shewed me a river of water of life , bright as crystal , going out of the throne of God and of the Lamb .
2 In the midst of its street , and of the river , on this side and on that side , tree of life , producing twelve fruits , in each month yielding its fruit ; and the leaves of the tree for healing of the nations .
3 And no curse shall be any more ; and the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it ; and his servants shall serve him ,
4 and they shall see his face ; and his name on their foreheads .
5 And night shall not be any more , and no need of a lamp , and light of sun ; for Lord God shall shine upon them , and they shall reign to the ages of ages .
6 And he said to me , These words faithful and true ; and Lord God of the spirits of the prophets has sent his angel to shew to his bondmen the things which must soon come to pass .
7 And behold , I come quickly . Blessed he who keeps the words of the prophecy of this book .
8 And I , John , he who heard and saw these things . And when I heard and saw , I fell down to do homage before the feet of the angel who shewed me these things .
9 And he says to me , See [ thou do it ] not . I am thy fellow-bondman , and [ the fellow-bondman ] of thy brethren the prophets , and of those who keep the words of this book . Do homage to God .
10 And he says to me , Seal not the words of the prophecy of this book . The time is near .
11 Let him that does unrighteously do unrighteously still ; and let the filthy make himself filthy still ; and let him that is righteous practise righteousness still ; and he that is holy , let him be sanctified still .
12 Behold , I come quickly , and my reward with me , to render to every one as his work shall be .
13 *I* the Alpha and the Omega , first and last , the beginning and the end .
14 Blessed they that wash their robes , that they may have right to the tree of life , and that they should go in by the gates into the city .
15 Without the dogs , and the sorcerers , and the fornicators , and the murderers , and the idolaters , and every one that loves and makes a lie .
