1 Therefore having been justified on the principle of faith , we have peace towards God through our Lord Jesus Christ ;
2 by whom we have also access by faith into this favour in which we stand , and we boast in hope of the glory of God .
3 And not only , but we also boast in tribulations , knowing that tribulation works endurance ;
4 and endurance , experience ; and experience , hope ;
5 and hope does not make ashamed , because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by Holy Spirit which has been given to us :
6 for we being still without strength , in due time Christ has died for ungodly .
7 For scarcely for just will one die , for perhaps for good some one might also dare to die ;
8 but God commends *his* love to us , in that , we being still sinners , Christ has died for us .
9 Much rather therefore , having been now justified in [ the power of ] his blood , we shall be saved by him from wrath .
10 For if , being enemies , we have been reconciled to God through the death of his Son , much rather , having been reconciled , we shall be saved in [ the power of ] his life .
11 And not only , but [ we are ] making our boast in God , through our Lord Jesus Christ , through whom now we have received the reconciliation .
12 For this , even as by one man sin entered into the world , and by sin death ; and thus death passed upon all men , for that all have sinned :
13 ( for until law sin was in world ; but sin is not put to account when there is no law ;
14 but death reigned from Adam until Moses , even upon those who had not sinned in the likeness of Adam 's transgression , who is figure of him to come .
15 But not the act of favour as the offence ? For if by the offence of one the many have died , much rather has the grace of God , and the free gift in grace , which by the one man Jesus Christ , abounded unto the many .
16 And not as by one that has sinned the gift ? For the judgment of one to condemnation , but the act of favour , of many offences unto justification .
17 For if by the offence of the one death reigned by the one , much rather shall those who receive the abundance of grace , and of the free gift of righteousness , reign in life by the one Jesus Christ : )
18 so then as [ it was ] by one offence towards all men to condemnation , so by one righteousness towards all men for justification of life .
19 For as indeed by the disobedience of the one man the many have been constituted sinners , so also by the obedience of the one the many will be constituted righteous .
20 But law came in , in order that the offence might abound ; but where sin abounded grace has overabounded ,
21 in order that , even as sin has reigned in [ the power of ] death , so also grace might reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord .
