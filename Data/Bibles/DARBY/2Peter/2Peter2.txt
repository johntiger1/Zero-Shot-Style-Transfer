1 But there were false prophets also among the people , as there shall be also among you false teachers , who shall bring in by the bye destructive heresies , and deny the master that bought them , bringing upon themselves swift destruction ;
2 and many shall follow their dissolute ways , through whom the way of the truth shall be blasphemed .
3 And through covetousness , with well-turned words , will they make merchandise of you : for whom judgment of old is not idle , and their destruction slumbers not .
4 For if God spared not angels who had sinned , but having cast them down to the deepest pit of gloom has delivered them to chains of darkness [ to be ] kept for judgment ;
5 and spared not old world , but preserved Noe , eighth , a preacher of righteousness , having brought in flood upon world of ungodly ;
6 and having reduced cities of Sodom and Gomorrha to ashes , condemned with an overthrow , setting [ them as ] an example to those that should live an ungodly life ;
7 and saved righteous Lot , distressed with the abandoned conversation of the godless ,
8 ( for the righteous man through seeing and hearing , dwelling among them , tormented righteous soul day after day with lawless works , )
9 Lord knows to deliver the godly out of trial , and to keep unjust to day of judgment [ to be ] punished ;
10 and specially those who walk after the flesh in lust of uncleanness , and despise lordship . Bold [ are they ] , self-willed ; they do not fear speaking injuriously of dignities :
11 when angels , who are greater in might and power , do not bring against them , before the Lord , an injurious charge .
12 But these , as natural animals without reason , made to be caught and destroyed , speaking injuriously in things they are ignorant of , shall also perish in their own corruption ,
13 receiving reward of unrighteousness ; accounting ephemeral indulgence pleasure ; spots and blemishes , rioting in their own deceits , feasting with you ;
14 having eyes full of adultery , and that cease not from sin , alluring unestablished souls ; having a heart practised in covetousness , children of curse ;
15 having left straight way they have gone astray , having followed in the path of Balaam [ the son ] of Bosor , who loved reward of unrighteousness ;
16 but had reproof of his own wickednessâ€” dumb ass speaking with man 's voice forbad the folly of the prophet .
17 These are springs without water , and mists driven by storm , to whom the gloom of darkness is reserved [ for ever ] .
18 For speaking great highflown words of vanity , they allure with lusts of flesh , by dissoluteness , those who have just fled those who walk in error ,
19 promising them liberty , while they themselves are slaves of corruption ; for by whom a man is subdued , by him is he also brought into slavery .
20 For if after having escaped the pollutions of the world through knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ , again entangled , they are subdued by these , their last state is worse than the first .
21 For it were better for them not to have known the way of righteousness , than having known to turn back from the holy commandment delivered to them .
22 But that of the true proverb has happened to them : dog turned back to his own vomit ; and , washed sow to rolling in mud .
