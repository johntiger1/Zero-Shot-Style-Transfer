1 But concerning spiritual , brethren , I do not wish you to be ignorant .
2 Ye know that when ye were [ of the ] nations [ ye were ] led away to dumb idols , in whatever way ye might be led .
3 I give you therefore to know , that no one , speaking in [ the power of the ] Spirit of God , says , Curse Jesus ; and no one can say , Lord Jesus , unless in [ the power of the ] Holy Spirit .
4 But there are distinctions of gifts , but the same Spirit ;
5 and there are distinctions of services , and the same Lord ;
6 and there are distinctions of operations , but the same God who operates all things in all .
7 But to each the manifestation of the Spirit is given for profit .
8 For to one , by the Spirit , is given word of wisdom ; and to another word of knowledge , according to the same Spirit ;
9 and to a different one faith , in [ the power of ] the same Spirit ; and to another gifts of healing in [ the power of ] the same Spirit ;
10 and to another operations of miracles ; and to another prophecy ; and to another discerning of spirits ; and to a different one kinds of tongues ; and to another interpretation of tongues .
11 But all these things operates the one and the same Spirit , dividing to each in particular according as he pleases .
12 For even as the body is one and has many members , but all the members of the body , being many , are one body , so also the Christ .
13 For also in [ the power of ] one Spirit *we* have all been baptised into one body , whether Jews or Greeks , whether bondmen or free , and have all been given to drink of one Spirit .
14 For also the body is not one member but many .
15 If the foot say , Because I am not a hand I am not of the body , is it on account of this not indeed of the body ?
16 And if the ear say , Because I am not an eye I am not of the body , is it on account of this not indeed of the body ?
17 If the whole body an eye , where the hearing ? if all hearing , where the smelling ?
18 But now God has set the members , each one of them in the body , according as it has pleased .
19 But if all were one member , where the body ?
20 But now the members many , and the body one .
21 The eye can not say to the hand , I have not need of thee ; or again , the head to the feet , I have not need of you .
22 But much rather , the members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary ;
23 and those of the body which we esteem to be the more void of honour , these we clothe with more abundant honour ; and our uncomely have more abundant comeliness ;
24 but our comely have not need . But God has tempered the body together , having given more abundant honour to [ the part ] that lacked ;
25 that there might be no division in the body , but that the members might have the same concern one for another .
26 And if one member suffer , all the members suffer with ; and if one member be glorified , all the members rejoice with .
27 Now *ye* are Christ 's body , and members in particular .
28 And God has set certain in the assembly : first , apostles ; secondly , prophets ; thirdly , teachers ; then miraculous powers ; then gifts of healings ; helps ; governments ; kinds of tongues .
29 all apostles ? all prophets ? all teachers ? all [ in possession of ] miraculous powers ?
30 have all gifts of healings ? do all speak with tongues ? do all interpret ?
31 But desire earnestly the greater gifts , and yet shew I unto you a way of more surpassing excellence .
