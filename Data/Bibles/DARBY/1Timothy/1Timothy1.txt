1 Paul , apostle of Jesus Christ , according to command of God our Saviour , and of Christ Jesus our hope ,
2 to Timotheus , true child in faith : grace , mercy , peace , from God our Father and Christ Jesus our Lord .
3 Even as I begged thee to remain in Ephesus , [ when I was ] going to Macedonia , that thou mightest enjoin some not to teach other doctrines ,
4 nor to turn their minds to fables and interminable genealogies , which bring questionings rather than God 's dispensation , which in faith .
5 But the end of what is enjoined is love out of a pure heart and a good conscience and unfeigned faith ;
6 which some having missed , have turned aside to vain discourse ,
7 desiring to be law-teachers , not understanding either what they say or concerning what they strenuously affirm .
8 Now we know that the law good if any one uses it lawfully ,
9 knowing this , that law has not its application to a righteous person , but to lawless and insubordinate , to impious and sinful , to unholy and profane , to smiters of fathers and smiters of mothers ; to murderers ,
10 fornicators , sodomites , kidnappers , liars , perjurers ; and if any other thing is opposed to sound teaching ,
11 according to the glad tidings of the glory of the blessed God , with which *I* have been entrusted .
12 I thank Christ Jesus our Lord , who has given me power , that he has counted me faithful , appointing to ministry him
13 who before was a blasphemer and persecutor , and an insolent overbearing : but mercy was shewn me because I did it ignorantly , in unbelief .
14 But the grace of our Lord surpassingly over-abounded with faith and love , which in Christ Jesus .
15 Faithful the word , and worthy of all acceptation , that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners , of whom *I* am first .
16 But for this reason mercy was shewn me , that in me , first , Jesus Christ might display the whole long-suffering , for a delineation of those about to believe on him to life eternal .
17 Now to the King of the ages , incorruptible , invisible , only God , honour and glory to the ages of ages . Amen .
18 This charge , child Timotheus , I commit to thee , according to the prophecies as to thee preceding , in order that thou mightest war by them the good warfare ,
19 maintaining faith and a good conscience ; which some , having put away , have made shipwreck as to faith ;
20 of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander , whom I have delivered to Satan , that they may be taught by discipline not to blaspheme .
