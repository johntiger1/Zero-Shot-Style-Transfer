1 Shout aloud unto Jehovah , all the earth !
2 Serve Jehovah with joy : come before his presence with exultation .
3 Know that Jehovah is God : it is he that hath made us , and not we ourselves ; [ we are ] his people , and the sheep of his pasture .
4 Enter into his gates with thanksgiving into his courts with praise ; give thanks unto him , bless his name :
5 For Jehovah is good ; his loving-kindness for ever ; and his faithfulness from generation to generation .
