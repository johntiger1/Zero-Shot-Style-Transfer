1 His foundation is in the mountains of holiness .
2 Jehovah loveth the gates of Zion more than all the habitations of Jacob .
3 Glorious things are spoken of thee , O city of God . Selah .
4 I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon among them that know me ; behold Philistia , and Tyre , with Ethiopia : this was born there .
5 And of Zion it shall be said , This one and that one was born in her ; and the Most High himself shall establish her .
6 Jehovah will count , when he inscribeth the peoples , This was born there . Selah .
7 As well the singers as the dancers [ shall say ] , All my springs are in thee .
