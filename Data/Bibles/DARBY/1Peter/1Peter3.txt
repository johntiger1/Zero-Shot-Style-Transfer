1 Likewise , wives , subject to your own husbands , that , even if any are disobedient to the word , they may be gained without word by the conversation of the wives ,
2 having witnessed your pure conversation [ carried out ] in fear ;
3 whose adorning let it not be that outward one of tressing of hair , and wearing gold , or putting on apparel ;
4 but the hidden man of the heart , in the incorruptible of a meek and quiet spirit , which in the sight of God is of great price .
5 For thus also the holy women who have hoped in God heretofore adorned themselves , being subject to their own husbands ;
6 as Sarah obeyed Abraham , calling him lord ; whose children ye have become , doing good , and not fearing with any kind of consternation .
7 husbands likewise , dwell with according to knowledge , as with a weaker , the female , vessel , giving honour , as also fellow-heirs of grace of life , that your prayers be not hindered .
8 Finally , all of one mind , sympathising , full of brotherly love , tender hearted , humble minded ;
9 not rendering evil for evil , or railing for railing ; but on the contrary , blessing , because ye have been called to this , that ye should inherit blessing .
10 For he that will love life and see good days , let him cause his tongue to cease from evil and his lips that they speak no guile .
11 And let him avoid evil , and do good ; let him seek peace and pursue it ;
12 because eyes of Lord on righteous , and his ears towards their supplications ; but face of Lord against them that do evil .
13 And who shall injure you if ye have become imitators of that which good ?
14 But if also ye should suffer for righteousness ' sake , blessed [ are ye ] ; but be not afraid of their fear , neither be troubled ;
15 but sanctify Lord the Christ in your hearts , and always prepared to an answer every one that asks you to give an account of the hope that in you , but with meekness and fear ;
16 having a good conscience , that [ as to that ] in which they speak against you as evildoers , they may be ashamed who calumniate your good conversation in Christ .
17 For [ it is ] better , if the will of God should will it , to suffer well-doers than evildoers ;
18 for Christ indeed has once suffered for sins , just for unjust , that he might bring us to God ; being put to death in flesh , but made alive in Spirit ,
19 in which also going he preached to the spirits [ which are ] in prison ,
20 heretofore disobedient , when the longsuffering of God waited in days of Noah while the ark was preparing , into which few , that is , eight souls , were saved through water :
21 which figure also now saves you , baptism , not a putting away of filth of flesh , but demand as before God of a good conscience , by resurrection of Jesus Christ ,
22 who is at right hand of God , gone into heaven , angels and authorities and powers being subjected to him .
