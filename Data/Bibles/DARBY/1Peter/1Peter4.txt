1 Christ , then , having suffered for us in flesh , do *ye* also arm yourselves with the same mind ; for he that has suffered in flesh has done with sin ,
2 no longer to live the rest of time in flesh to men 's lusts , but to God 's will .
3 For the time past sufficient [ for us ] to have wrought the will of the Gentiles , walking in lasciviousness , lusts , wine-drinking , revels , drinkings , and unhallowed idolatries .
4 Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with to the same sink of corruption , speaking injuriously [ of you ] ;
5 who shall render account to him who is ready to judge living and dead .
6 For to this were the glad tidings preached to dead also , that they might be judged , as regards men , after flesh , but live , as regards God , after Spirit .
7 But the end of all things is drawn nigh : be sober therefore , and be watchful unto prayers ;
8 but before all things having fervent love among yourselves , because love covers a multitude of sins ;
9 hospitable one to another , without murmuring ;
10 each according as he has received a gift , ministering it to one another , as good stewards of various grace of God .
11 If any one speak—as oracles of God ; if any one minister—as of strength which God supplies ; that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ , to whom is the glory and the might for the ages of ages . Amen .
12 Beloved , take not strange the fire [ of persecution ] which has taken place amongst you for trial , as if a strange thing was happening to you ;
13 but as ye have share in the sufferings of Christ , rejoice , that in the revelation of his glory also ye may rejoice with exultation .
14 If ye are reproached in name of Christ , blessed [ are ye ] ; for the of glory and the Spirit of God rests upon you : [ on their part he is blasphemed , but on your part he is glorified . ]
15 Let none of you suffer indeed as murderer , or thief , or evildoer , or as overseer of other people 's matters ;
16 but if as a christian , let him not be ashamed , but glorify God in this name .
17 For the time of having the judgment begin from the house of God [ is come ] ; but if first from us , what [ shall be ] the end of those who obey not the glad tidings of God ?
18 And if the righteous is difficultly saved , where shall the impious and sinner appear ?
19 Wherefore also let them who suffer according to the will of God commit their souls in well-doing to a faithful Creator .
