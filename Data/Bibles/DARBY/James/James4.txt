1 Whence wars and whence fightings among you ? [ Is it ] not thence , â€”from your pleasures , which war in your members ?
2 Ye lust and have not : ye kill and are full of envy , and can not obtain ; ye fight and war ; ye have not because ye ask not .
3 Ye ask and receive not , because ye ask evilly , that ye may consume in your pleasures .
4 Adulteresses , know ye not that friendship with the world is enmity with God ? Whoever therefore is minded to be friend of the world is constituted enemy of God .
5 Think ye that the scripture speaks in vain ? Does the Spirit which has taken his abode in us desire enviously ?
6 But he gives more grace . Wherefore he says , God sets himself against proud , but gives grace to lowly .
7 Subject yourselves therefore to God . Resist the devil , and he will flee from you .
8 Draw near to God , and he will draw near to you . Cleanse hands , sinners , and purify hearts , ye double-minded .
9 Be wretched , and mourn , and weep : let your laughter be turned to mourning , and joy to heaviness .
10 Humble yourselves before Lord , and he shall exalt you .
11 Speak not against one another , brethren . He that speaks against brother , or judges his brother , speaks against law and judges law . But if thou judgest law , thou art not doer of law , but judge .
12 One is the lawgiver and judge , who is able to save and to destroy : but who art *thou* who judgest thy neighbour ?
13 Go to now , ye who say , To-day or to-morrow will we go into such a city and spend a year there , and traffic and make gain ,
14 ye who do not know what will be on the morrow , ( what your life ? It is even a vapour , appearing for a little while , and then disappearing , )
15 instead of your saying , If the Lord should will and we should live , we will also do this or that .
16 But now ye glory in your vauntings : all such glorying is evil .
17 To him therefore who knows how to do good , and does it not , to him it is sin .
